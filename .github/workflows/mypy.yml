name: Run MyPy

# Mypy is too slow to run as part of regular CI. The purpose of the jobs in
# this file is to cover running Mypy across:
#
#   - OSes: Linux, Windows and macOS
#   - Python versions: lowest/highest supported versions, and an intermediate one
#
# The build matrix aims for sparse coverage across those two dimensions.
# Use of BLAS/LAPACK and SIMD is disabled on purpose, because those things
# don't matter for static typing and this speeds up the builds.
#
# This is a separate job file so it's easy to trigger by hand.
