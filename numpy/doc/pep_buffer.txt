Abstract
========

This PEP proposes re-designing the buffer interface (PyBufferProcs
function pointers) to improve the way Python allows memory sharing
in Python 3.0

In particular, it is proposed that the character buffer portion 
of the API be elminated and the multiple-segment portion be 
re-designed in conjunction with allowing for strided memory
to be shared.   In addition, the new buffer interface will 
allow the sharing of any multi-dimensional nature of the
memory and what data-format the memory contains. 

This interface will allow any extension module to either 
create objects that share memory or create algorithms that
use and manipulate raw memory from arbitrary objects that 
export the interface. 


Rationale
=========

The Python 2.X buffer protocol allows different Python types to
exchange a pointer to a sequence of internal buffers.  This
functionality is *extremely* useful for sharing large segments of
memory between different high-level objects, but it is too limited and
has issues:

1. There is the little used "sequence-of-segments" option
   (bf_getsegcount) that is not motivated very well. 

2. There is the apparently redundant character-buffer option
   (bf_getcharbuffer)

3. There is no way for a consumer to tell the buffer-API-exporting
   object it is "finished" with its view of the memory and
   therefore no way for the exporting object to be sure that it is
   safe to reallocate the pointer to the memory that it owns (for
   example, the array object reallocating its memory after sharing
   it with the buffer object which held the original pointer led
   to the infamous buffer-object problem).

4. Memory is just a pointer with a length. There is no way to
   describe what is "in" the memory (float, int, C-structure, etc.)

5. There is no shape information provided for the memory.  But,
   several array-like Python types could make use of a standard
   way to describe the shape-interpretation of the memory
   (wxPython, GTK, pyQT, CVXOPT, PyVox, Audio and Video
   Libraries, ctypes, NumPy, data-base interfaces, etc.)

6. There is no way to share discontiguous memory (except through
   the sequence of segments notion).  

   There are two widely used libraries that use the concept of
   discontiguous memory: PIL and NumPy.  Their view of discontiguous
   arrays is different, though.  The proposed buffer interface allows
   sharing of either memory model.  Exporters will use only one        
   approach and consumers may choose to support discontiguous 
   arrays of each type however they choose. 

   NumPy uses the notion of constant striding in each dimension as its
   basic concept of an array. With this concept, a simple sub-region
   of a larger array can be described without copying the data.   T
   Thus, stride information is the additional information that must be
   shared. 

   The PIL uses a more opaque memory representation. Sometimes an
   image is contained in a contiguous segment of memory, but sometimes
   it is contained in an array of pointers to the contiguous segments
   (usually lines) of the image.  The PIL is where the idea of multiple
   buffer segments in the original buffer interface came from.   

   NumPy's strided memory model is used more often in computational
   libraries and because it is so simple it makes sense to support
   memory sharing using this model.  The PIL memory model is used often
   in C-code where a 2-d array can be then accessed using double
   pointer indirection:  e.g. image[i][j].  

   The buffer interface should allow the object to export either of these
   memory models.  Consumers are free to either require contiguous memory
   or write code to handle either memory model.  

Proposal Overview
=================

* Eliminate the char-buffer and multiple-segment sections of the
  buffer-protocol.

* Unify the read/write versions of getting the buffer.

* Add a new function to the interface that should be called when
  the consumer object is "done" with the memory area.  

* Add a new variable to allow the interface to describe what is in
  memory (unifying what is currently done now in struct and
  array)

* Add a new variable to allow the protocol to share shape information

* Add a new variable for sharing stride information

* Add a new mechanism for sharing arrays that must 
  be accessed using pointer indirection. 

* Fix all objects in the core and the standard library to conform
  to the new interface

* Extend the struct module to handle more format specifiers

* Extend the buffer object into a new memory object which places
  a Python veneer around the buffer interface. 


Specification
=============

Change the PyBufferProcs structure to

::

    typedef struct {
         getbufferproc bf_getbuffer
         releasebufferproc bf_releasebuffer
    }

::

    typedef int (*getbufferproc)(PyObject *obj, struct bufferinfo *view)

This function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure (and raises an error). 
The first variable is the "exporting" object.  The second argument is the
address to a bufferinfo structure

struct bufferinfo {
       PyObject *releaseobj;
       void *buf;
       Py_ssize_t len;
       int readonly;
       char *format;
       int ndims;
       Py_ssize_t *shape;
       Py_ssize_t *strides;
       Py_ssize_t *suboffsets;
}

Upon return, the bufferinfo structure is filled in with relevant
information about the buffer.  This same bufferinfo structure should
be passed to bf_releasebuffer when the consumer is done with the
memory. The caller is responsible for keeping a reference to obj until
releasebuffer is called.

The members of the bufferinfo structure are:

buf
    a pointer to the start of the memory for the object

len 
    the total bytes of memory the object uses.  This should be the
    same as the product of the shape array multiplied by the number of
    bytes per item of memory.

readonly
    an integer variable to hold whether or not the memory is
    readonly.  Non-zero means the memory is readonly, zero means the
    memory is writeable. 

format
    a format-string (following extended struct syntax) indicating what
    is in each element of of memory.  The number of elements is len /
    itemsize, where itemsize is the number of bytes implied by the
    format.  For standard unsigned bytes use a format string of "B".

ndims
    a variable storing the number of dimensions the memory represents.
    Should be >=0. 

shape
    an array of ``Py_ssize_t`` of length ``ndims`` indicating the
    shape of the memory as an N-D array.  Note that ``((*shape)[0] *
    ... * (*shape)[ndims-1])*itemsize = len``.  This can be NULL
    to indicate 1-d arrays. 

strides 
    address of a ``Py_ssize_t*`` variable that will be filled with a
    pointer to an array of ``Py_ssize_t`` of length ``*ndims``
    indicating the number of bytes to skip to get to the next element
    in each dimension.  If this is NULL, then the memory is assumed to
    be C-style contigous with the last dimension varying the fastest.

suboffsets
    address of a ``Py_ssize_t *`` variable that will be filled with a
    pointer to an array of ``Py_ssize_t`` of length ``*ndims``.  If
    these suboffset numbers are >=0, then the value stored along the
    respective dimension is a pointer and the suboffset value dictates
    how many bytes to add to the pointer after de-referencing.  A
    suboffset value that it negative indicates that no de-referencing
    should occur (striding in a contiguous memory block). If the value
    returned in suboffsets is NULL, then all suboffsets are assumed
    to be negative (i.e no de-referencing is needed). 

    For clarity, here is a function that returns a pointer to the
    element in an N-D array pointed to by an N-dimesional index when
    there are both strides and suboffsets.  

    void* get_item_pointer(int ndim, void* buf, Py_ssize_t* strides,
                           Py_ssize_t* suboffsets, Py_ssize_t *indices) {
        char* pointer = (char*)buf;
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < ndim; i++) {
            pointer += strides[i]*indices[i];
            if (suboffsets[i] >=0 ) {
                pointer = *((char**)pointer) + suboffsets[i];
            }   
        }
        return (void*)pointer;
    } 


The exporter is responsible for making sure the memory pointed to by
buf, format, shape, strides, and suboffsets is valid until
releasebuffer is called.  If the exporter wants to be able to change
shape, strides, and/or suboffsets before releasebuffer is called then
it should allocate those arrays when getbuffer is called and free them
when releasebuffer is called.


The same bufferinfo struct should be used in the other buffer
interface call. The caller is responsible for the memory of the
bufferinfo object itself.

``typedef int (*releasebufferproc)(PyObject *obj, struct bufferinfo *view)``
    Callers of getbufferproc must make sure that this function is
    called when memory previously acquired from the object is no
    longer needed.  The exporter of the interface must make sure that
    any memory pointed to in the bufferinfo structure remains valid
    until releasebuffer is called.

    Both of these routines are optional for a type object

    If the releasebuffer function is not provided then it does not ever
    need to be called. 
    
Exporters will need to define a releasebuffer function if they can
re-allocate their memory, strides, shape, suboffsets, or format
variables which they might share through the struct bufferinfo.
Several mechanisms could be used to keep track of how many getbuffer
calls have been made and shared.  Either a single variable could be
used to keep track of how many "views" have been exported, or a
linked-list of bufferinfo structures filled in could be maintained in
each objet.  All that is needed is to ensure that any memory shared
through the bufferinfo structure remains valid until releasebuffer is
called on that memory.


New C-API calls are proposed
============================

::

    int PyObject_CheckBuffer(PyObject *obj)

Return 1 if the getbuffer function is available otherwise 0.

::

    PyObject *PyObject_GetBuffer(PyObject *obj)

Return a memory-view object.

A memory-view object is an extended buffer object that can replace
the buffer object.  It's C-structure is

typedef struct {
    PyObject_HEAD
    PyObject *base;
    void *ptr;
    Py_ssize_t len;
    int readonly;
    char *format;
    int ndims;
    Py_ssize_t *shape;
    Py_ssize_t *strides;
    Py_ssize_t *suboffsets;
    int itemsize;
} PyBufferObject;

This is very similar to the current buffer object except offset has
been removed because ptr can just be modified by offset and a single
offset is not sufficient.  Also the hash has been removed because
using the buffer object has a hash even if it is read-only is rarely
useful.  The id of the buffer object should be used instead.

Also, the format, ndims, shape, strides, and suboffsets has been
added. These additions will allow multi-dimensional slicing of the
memory-view object which can be added at some point.  This object
always owns it's own shape, strides, and suboffsets arrays and it's own
format string, but always borrows the memory from the object pointed to
by base. 

The itemsize is a convenience and specifies the number of bytes
indicated by the format string if positive.  If negative, then the
number of bytes must be computed from the format string. 

This object never reallocates ptr, shape, strides, subboffsets or
format and therefore does not need to keep track of how many views it
has exported.

Thus, it does not define a releasebuffer function. 

::

    int PyObject_SizeFromFormat(char *)

Return the implied itemsize of the data-format area from a struct-style
description.

::

    int PyObject_GetContiguous(PyObject *obj, void **buf, Py_ssize_t *len)

Return a contiguous chunk of memory representing the buffer.  If a
copy is made then return 1.  If no copy was needed return 0.  If an
error occurred in probing the buffer interface, then return -1.  The
contiguous chunk of memory is pointed to by ``*buf`` and the length
of that memory is ``*len``.  The buffer is C-style contiguous
meaning the last dimension varies the fastest. 

:: 

    int PyObject_CopyToObject(PyObject *obj, void *buf, Py_ssize_t len)

Copy ``len`` bytes of data pointed to by the contiguous chunk of
memory pointed to by ``buf`` into the buffer exported by obj.  Return
0 on success and return -1 and raise an error on failure.  If the
object does not have a writeable buffer, then an error is raised.  The
data is copied into an array in C-style contiguous fashion meaning the
last variable varies the fastest.

The last two C-API calls allow a standard way of getting data in and
out of Python objects no matter how it is actually stored.  These
calls use the buffer interface to perform their work.

::
    int PyObject_IsContiguous(int *ndims, Py_ssize_t *shape, 
                              Py_ssize_t *strides, Py_ssize_t *suboffsets)

Return 1 if the memory defined by shape, strides, and suboffsets is
contiguous.  Return 0 otherwise.

::
    void PyObject_FillContiguousStrides(int *ndims, Py_ssize_t *shape, 
                                        Py_ssize_t *strides)

Fill the strides array with byte-strides of a contiguous array of the
given shape.



Additions to the struct string-syntax
=====================================

The struct string-syntax is missing some characters to fully
implement data-format descriptions already available elsewhere (in
ctypes and NumPy for example).  Here are the proposed additions:


================  ===========
Character         Description
================  ===========
't'               bit (number before states how many bits)
'?'               platform _Bool type
'g'               long double  
'Z'               complex (whatever the next specifier is)
'c'               ucs-1 (latin-1) encoding 
'u'               ucs-2 
'w'               ucs-4 
'O'               pointer to Python Object 
'T{}'             structure (detailed layout inside {}) 
'(k1,k2,...,kn)'  multi-dimensional array of whatever follows 
':name:'          optional name of the preceeding element 
'&'               specific pointer (prefix before another charater) 
'X{}'             pointer to a function (optional function 
                                         signature inside {})
' '               ignored (allow better readability)
================  ===========

The struct module will be changed to understand these as well and
return appropriate Python objects on unpacking.  Un-packing a
long-double will return a decimal object.  Unpacking 'u' or
'w' will return Python unicode.  Unpacking a multi-dimensional
array will return a list of lists.  Un-packing a pointer will
return a ctypes pointer object.  Un-packing a bit will return a
Python Bool.  Spaces in the struct-string syntax will be ignored.
Unpacking a named-object will return a Python class with attributes 
having those names. 

Endian-specification ('=','>','<') is also allowed inside the
string so that it can change if needed.  The previously-specified
endian string is in force until changed.  The default endian is '='.

According to the struct-module, a number can preceed a character
code to specify how many of that type there are.  The
(k1,k2,...,kn) extension also allows specifying if the data is
supposed to be viewed as a (C-style contiguous, last-dimension
varies the fastest) multi-dimensional array of a particular format.

Functions should be added to ctypes to create a ctypes object from
a struct description, and add long-double, and ucs-2 to ctypes.

Examples of Data-Format Descriptions
====================================

Here are some examples of C-structures and how they would be
represented using the struct-style syntax:

float
    'f'
complex double
    'Zd'
RGB Pixel data
    'BBB' or 'B:r: B:g: B:b:'
Mixed endian (weird but possible)
    '>i:big: <i:little:'
Nested structure
    ::

        struct {
             int ival;
             struct {
                 unsigned short sval;
                 unsigned char bval;
                 unsigned char cval;
             } sub;
        }
        'i:ival: T{H:sval: B:bval: B:cval:}:sub:'
Nested array
    ::

        struct {
             int ival;
             double data[16*4];
        }
        'i:ival: (16,4)d:data:'

Code to be affected
===================

All objects and modules in Python that export or consume the old
buffer interface will be modified.  Here is a partial list.

* buffer object
* bytes object
* string object
* array module
* struct module
* mmap module
* ctypes module

Anything else using the buffer API.  


Issues and Details
==================

The proposed locking mechanism relies entirely on the exporter 
object to not alter the memory pointed to by the buffer structure 
until a corresponding releasebuffer is called.  

The sharing of strided memory and suboffsets is new and can be seen as a
modification of the multiple-segment interface.  It is motivated by
NumPy and the PIL.  NumPy objects should be able to share their strided memory
with code that understands how to manage strided memory because
strided memory is very common when interfacing with compute libraries.

Also it should be able to write generic code that works with both
kinds of memory.

Currently the struct module does not allow specification of nested
structures.  The proposed modifications to struct allow for specifying
nested structures as several ways of viewing memory areas (e.g. ctypes
and NumPy) already allow this.

Memory management of the format string and the shape and strides
array is always the responsibility of the exporting object and can
be shared between different views. If the consuming object needs to
keep these memory areas longer than the view is held, then it must
copy them to its own memory.
