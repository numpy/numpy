Overview
--------
In general, we follow the standard Python style conventions as described here:
 * `Style Guide for C Code <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0007.html>`_
 * `Style Guide for Python Code <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html>`_
 * `Docstring Conventions <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html>`_

Additional PEPs of interest regarding documentation of code:
 * `Docstring Processing Framework <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0256.html>`_
 * `Docutils Design Specification <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0258.html>`_

Use a code checker:
 * `pylint <http://www.logilab.org/857>`_
 * `pyflakes` easy_install pyflakes
 * `pep8.py <http://svn.browsershots.org/trunk/devtools/pep8/pep8.py>`_

If you prefer the use of abbreviated module names, we suggest
the following commonly used import conventions::

   import numpy as np
   import scipy as sp
   import matplotlib as mpl
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

It is still perfectly acceptable to use unnabreviated module names.

Docstring Standard
------------------
A documentation string (docstring) is a string that describes a module,
function, class, or method definition.  The docstring is a special attribute
of the object (``object.__doc__``) and, for consistency, is surrounded by
triple double quotes, i.e.::

   """This is the form of a docstring.

   It can be spread over several lines.

   """

NumPy, SciPy_, and the scikits follow a common convention for
docstrings that provides for consistency, while also allowing our
toolchain to produce well-formatted reference guides.  This document
describes the current community consensus for such a standard.  If you
have suggestions for improvements, post them on the `numpy-discussion
list`_, together with the epydoc output.

Our docstring standard uses `re-structured text (reST)
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ syntax and is rendered
using tools like epydoc_ or sphinx_ (pre-processors that understand
the particular documentation style we are using).  While a rich set of
markup is available, we limit ourselves to a very basic subset, in
order to provide docstrings that are easy to read on text-only
terminals.

A guiding principle is that human readers of the text are given
precedence over contorting docstrings so our tools produce nice
output.  Rather than sacrificing the readability of the docstrings, we
have chosen to write pre-processors to assist tools like epydoc_ or
sphinx_ in their task.

Status
------
We are busy converting existing docstrings to the new format,
expanding them where they are lacking, as well as writing new ones for
undocumented functions.  Volunteers are welcome to join the effort on
our new wiki-based documentation system (see the `Developer Zone
<http://www.scipy.org/Developer_Zone/DocMarathon2008>`_).

Sections
--------
The sections of the docstring are:

1. **Short summary**

   A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the function
   name, e.g.

   ::

     def add(a,b):
        """Return the sum of two numbers.

        """

   The function signature is normally found by introspection and
   displayed by the help function.  For some functions (notably those
   written in C) the signature is not available, so we have to specify
   it as the first line of the docstring::

     """
     add(a,b)

     Return the sum of two numbers.

     """

2. **Extended summary**

   A few sentences giving an extended description.  This section
   should be used to clarify *functionality*, not to discuss
   implementation detail or background theory, which should rather be
   explored in the **notes** section below.  You may refer to the
   parameters and the function name, but parameter descriptions still
   belong in the **parameters** section.

3. **Parameters**

   Description of the function arguments, keywords and their
   respective types.

   ::

     Parameters
     ----------
     x : type
        Description of parameter `x`.

   Enclose variables in single back-tics.  If it is not necessary to
   specify a keyword argument, use ``optional``::

     x : int, optional

   Optional keyword parameters have default values, which are
   displayed as part of the function signature.  They can also be
   detailed in the description::

     Description of parameter `x` (the default is -1, which implies summation
     over all axes).

   When a parameter can only assume one of a fixed set of values,
   those values can be listed in braces ::

     x : {True, False}
         Description of `x`.

4. **Returns**

   Explanation of the returned values and their types, of the same
   format as **parameters**.

5. **Other parameters**

   An optional section used to describe infrequently used parameters.
   It should only be used if a function has a large number of keyword
   prameters, to prevent cluttering the **parameters** section.

6. **Raises**

   An optional section detailing which errors get raised and under
   what conditions::

     Raises
     ------
     LinAlgException
         If the matrix is not numerically invertible.

7. **See Also**

   An optional section used to refer to related code.  This section
   can be very useful, but should be used judiciously.  The goal is to
   direct users to other functions they may not be aware of, or have
   easy means of discovering (by looking at the module docstring, for
   example).  Routines whose docstrings further explain parameters
   used by this function are good candidates.

   As an example, for ``numpy.mean`` we would have::

     See Also
     --------
     average : Weighted average

8. **Notes**

   An optional section that provides additional information about the
   code, possibly including a discussion of the algorithm. This
   section may include mathematical equations, written in
   `LaTeX <http://www.latex-project.org/>`_ format::

     The FFT is a fast implementation of the discrete Fourier transform:

     .. math:: X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n}

   Equations can also be typeset underneath the math directive::

     The discrete-time Fourier time-convolution property states that

     .. math::

          x(n) * y(n) \Leftrightarrow X(e^{j\omega } )Y(e^{j\omega } )\\
          another equation here

   Math can furthermore be used inline, i.e.

   ::

     The value of :math:`omega` is larger than 5.

   Note that LaTeX is not particularly easy to read, so use equations
   sparingly.

   Images are allowed, but should not be central to the explanation;
   users viewing the docstring as text must be able to comprehend its
   meaning without resorting to an image viewer.  These additional
   illustrations are included using::

     .. image:: filename

   where filename is a path relative to the reference guide source
   directory.

9. **References**

   References cited in the **notes** section may be listed here,
   e.g. if you cited the article below using the text ``[1]_``,
   include it as in the list as follows::

     .. [1] O. McNoleg, "The integration of GIS, remote sensing,
        expert systems and adaptive co-kriging for environmental habitat
        modelling of the Highland Haggis using object-oriented, fuzzy-logic
        and neural-network techniques," Computers & Geosciences, vol. 22,
        pp. 585-588, 1996.

   which renders as

   .. [1] O. McNoleg, "The integration of GIS, remote sensing,
      expert systems and adaptive co-kriging for environmental habitat
      modelling of the Highland Haggis using object-oriented, fuzzy-logic
      and neural-network techniques," Computers & Geosciences, vol. 22,
      pp. 585-588, 1996.

   Referencing sources of a temporary nature, like web pages, is
   discouraged.  References are meant to augment the docstring, but
   should not be required to understand it.  Follow the `citation
   format of the IEEE
   <http://www.ieee.org/pubs/transactions/auinfo03.pdf>`_, which
   states that references are numbered, starting from one, in the
   order in which they are cited.

10. **Examples**

    An optional section for examples, using the `doctest
    <http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-doctest.html>`_ format.
    This section is meant to illustrate usage, not to provide a
    testing framework -- for that, use the ``tests/`` directory.
    While optional, this section is very strongly encouraged. You can
    run these examples by doing::

      >>> import doctest
      >>> doctest.testfile('example.py')

    or, using nose,

    ::

      $ nosetests --with-doctest example.py

    Blank lines are used to seperate doctests.  When they occur in the
    expected output, they should be replaced by ``<BLANKLINE>`` (see
    `doctest options
    <http://docs.python.org/lib/doctest-options.html>`_ for other such
    special strings), e.g.

    ::

      >>> print "a\n\nb"
      a
      <BLANKLINE>
      b

11. **Indexing tags***

    Each function needs to be categorised for indexing purposes.  Use
    the ``index`` directive::

      .. index::
         :refguide: ufunc, trigonometry

    To index a function as a sub-category of a class, separate index
    entries by a semi-colon, e.g.

    ::

      :refguide: ufunc, numpy;reshape, other

    A `list of available categories
    <http://www.scipy.org/Developer_Zone/ReferenceGuide>`_ is
    available.


Common reST concepts
--------------------
For paragraphs, indentation is significant and indicates indentation in the
output. New paragraphs are marked with a blank line.

Use *italics*, **bold**, and ``courier`` if needed in any explanations
(but not for variable names and doctest code or multi-line code).
Variable, module and class names should be written between single
backticks (```numpy```).

A more extensive example of reST markup can be found in `this example
document <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/demo.txt>`_;
the `quick reference
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ is
useful while editing.

Line spacing and indentation are significant and should be carefully
followed.
