/*
 * Logic for deciding when binops should return NotImplemented versus when
 * they should go ahead and call a ufunc (or similar).
 *
 * The interaction between binop methods (ndarray.__add__ and friends) and
 * ufuncs (which dispatch to __array_ufunc__) is both complicated in its own
 * right, and also has complicated historical constraints.
 *
 * In the very old days, the rules were:
 * - If the other argument has a higher __array_priority__, then return
 *   NotImplemented
 * - Otherwise, call the corresponding ufunc.
 *   - And the ufunc might return NotImplemented based on some complex
 *     criteria that I won't reproduce here.
 *
 * Ufuncs no longer return NotImplemented (except in a few marginal situations
 * which are being phased out -- see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5864)
 *
 * So as of 1.9, the effective rules were:
 * - If the other argument has a higher __array_priority__, and is *not* a
 *   subclass of ndarray, then return NotImplemented. (If it is a subclass,
 *   the regular Python rules have already given it a chance to run; so if we
 *   are running, then it means the other argument has already returned
 *   NotImplemented and is basically asking us to take care of things.)
 * - Otherwise call the corresponding ufunc.
 *
 * We would like to get rid of __array_priority__, and __array_ufunc__
 * provides a large part of a replacement for it. Once __array_ufunc__ is
 * widely available, the simplest dispatch rules that might possibly work
 * would be:
 * - Always call the corresponding ufunc.
 *
 * But:
 * - Doing this immediately would break backwards compatibility -- there's a
 *   lot of code using __array_priority__ out there.
 * - It's not at all clear whether __array_ufunc__ actually is sufficient for
 *   all use cases. (See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5844 for lots
 *   of discussion of this, and in particular
 *     https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5844#issuecomment-112014014
 *   for a summary of some conclusions.) Also, python 3.6 defines a standard
 *   where setting a special-method name to None is a signal that that method
 *   cannot be used.
 *
 * So for 1.13, we are going to try the following rules.
 *
 * For binops like a.__add__(b):
 * - If b does not define __array_ufunc__, apply the legacy rule:
 *   - If not isinstance(b, a.__class__), and b.__array_priority__ is higher
 *     than a.__array_priority__, return NotImplemented
 * - If b does define __array_ufunc__ but it is None, return NotImplemented
 * - Otherwise, call the corresponding ufunc.
 *
 * For in-place operations like a.__iadd__(b)
 * - If b does not define __array_ufunc__, apply the legacy rule:
 *   - If not isinstance(b, a.__class__), and b.__array_priority__ is higher
 *     than a.__array_priority__, return NotImplemented
 * - Otherwise, call the corresponding ufunc.
 *
 * For reversed operations like b.__radd__(a) we call the corresponding ufunc.
 *
 * Rationale for __radd__: This is because by the time the reversed operation
 * is called, there are only two possibilities: The first possibility is that
 * the current class is a strict subclass of the other class. In practice, the
 * only way this will happen is if b is a strict subclass of a, and a is
 * ndarray or a subclass of ndarray, and neither a nor b has actually
 * overridden this method. In this case, Python will never call a.__add__
 * (because it's identical to b.__radd__), so we have no-one to defer to;
 * there's no reason to return NotImplemented. The second possibility is that
 * b.__add__ has already been called and returned NotImplemented. Again, in
 * this case there is no point in returning NotImplemented.
 *
 * Rationale for __iadd__: In-place operations do not take all the trouble
 * above, because if __iadd__ returns NotImplemented then Python will silently
 * convert the operation into an out-of-place operation, i.e. 'a += b' will
 * silently become 'a = a + b'. We don't want to allow this for arrays,
 * because it will create unexpected memory allocations, break views, etc.
 * However, backwards compatibility requires that we follow the rules of
 * __array_priority__ for arrays that define it. For classes that use the new
 * __array_ufunc__ mechanism we simply defer to the ufunc. That has the effect
 * that when the other array has__array_ufunc = None a TypeError will be raised.
 *
 * In the future we might change these rules further. For example, we plan to
 * eventually deprecate __array_priority__ in cases where __array_ufunc__ is
 * not present.
