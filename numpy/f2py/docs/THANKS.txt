Many people have contributed to the F2PY project in terms of interest,
encouragement, suggestions, criticism, bug reports, code
contributions, and keeping me busy with developing F2PY. For all that
I thank

(This list may not be complete. Please forgive me if I have left you
out and let me know, I'll add your name.)

Special thanks are due to ...

Eric Jones - he and Travis O. are responsible for starting the
numpy_distutils project that allowed to move most of the platform and
compiler specific codes out from F2PY. This simplified maintaining the
F2PY project considerably.

Joaquim R R A Martins - he made possible for me to test F2PY on IRIX64
platform. He also presented our paper about F2PY in the 9th Python
Conference that I planned to attend but had to cancel in very last
minutes.

Travis Oliphant - his knowledge and experience on Numerical Python
C/API has been invaluable in early development of the F2PY program.
His major contributions are call-back mechanism and copying N-D arrays
of arbitrary types.

Todd Miller - he is responsible for Numarray support in F2PY.

Thanks!
