It provides:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Testing:

- NumPy versions &ge; 1.15 require `pytest`
- NumPy versions &lt; 1.15 require `nose`

Tests can then be run after installation with:

    python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'


Call for Contributions
----------------------

The NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!

Small improvements or fixes are always appreciated; issues labeled as "good
first issue" may be a good starting point. If you are considering larger
contributions to the source code, please contact us through the [mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion) first. 

Writing code isn’t the only way to contribute to NumPy. You can also: 
- review pull requests
- triage issues
- develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials
- maintain and improve [our website](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org)
- develop graphic design for our brand assets and promotional materials

comment on a relevant issue that is already open.

Our preferred channels of communication are all public, but if you’d like to
speak to us in private first, contact our community coordinators at
numpy-team@googlegroups.com or on Slack (write numpy-team@googlegroups.com for
