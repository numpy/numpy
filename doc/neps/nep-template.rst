Abstract
--------

The abstract should be a short description of what the NEP will achieve.


Detailed description
--------------------

This section describes the need for the NEP.  It should describe the existing
problem that it is trying to solve and why this NEP makes the situation better.
It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used and
perhaps some use cases.


Implementation
--------------

This section lists the major steps required to implement the NEP.  Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which
steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes sense, each  step should
include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this NEP should
be linked to from here.  (A NEP does not need to be implemented in a single
pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).


Backward compatibility
----------------------

This section describes the ways in which the NEP breaks backward compatibility.


Alternatives
------------

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should
be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.


Discussion
----------

This section may just be a bullet list including links to any discussions
regarding the NEP:

- This includes links to mailing list threads or relevant GitHub issues.
