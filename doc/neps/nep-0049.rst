NEP 49 — Data allocation strategies
===================================

Abstract
--------

The ``numpy.ndarray`` requires additional memory allocations
to hold ``numpy.ndarray.strides``, ``numpy.ndarray.shape`` and
``numpy.ndarray.data`` attributes. These attributes are specially allocated
after creating the python object in ``__new__`` method.

This NEP proposes a mechanism to override the memory management strategy used
for ``ndarray->data`` with user-provided alternatives. This allocation holds
the arrays data and is can be very large. As accessing this data often becomes
a performance bottleneck, custom allocation strategies to guarantee data
alignment or pinning allocations to specialized memory hardware can enable
hardware-specific optimizations. The other allocatations remain unchanged.

Motivation and Scope
--------------------

Users may wish to override the internal data memory routines with ones of their
own. Two such use-cases are to ensure data alignment and to pin certain
allocations to certain NUMA cores. This desire for alignment was disucssed
multiple times on the mailing list `in 2005`_,  and in `issue 5312`_ in 2014,
which led to `PR 5457`_ and more mailing list discussions here_ `and here`_. In
a comment on the issue `from 2017`_, a user described how 64-byte alignment
improved performance by 40x.

Also related is `issue 14177`_ around the use of ``madvise`` and huge pages on
Linux.

Various tracing and profiling libraries like filprofiler_ or `electric fence`_
override ``malloc``.

The long CPython discussion of `BPO 18835`_  began with discussing the need for
``PyMem_Alloc32`` and ``PyMem_Alloc64``.  The early conclusion was that the
cost (of wasted padding) vs. the benifit of aligned memory is best left to the
user, but then evolves into a discussion of various proposals to deal with
memory allocations, including `PEP 445`_ `memory interfaces`_ to
``PyTraceMalloc_Track`` which apparently was explictly added for NumPy.

Allowing users to implement different strategies via the NumPy C-API will
enable exploration of this rich area of possible optimizations. The intention
is to create a flexible enough interface without burdening normative users.

Usage and Impact
----------------

The new functions can only be accessed via the NumPy C-API. An example is
included later in this NEP. The added ``struct`` will increase the size of the
``ndarray`` object. It is a necessary price to pay for this approach. We
can be reasonably sure that the change in size will have a minimal impact on
end-user code because NumPy version 1.20 already changed the object size.

The implementation preserves the use of ``PyTraceMalloc_Track`` to track
allocations already present in NumPy.

Backward compatibility
----------------------

The design will not break backward compatibility. Projects that were assigning
to the ``ndarray->data`` pointer were already breaking the current memory
management strategy and should restore
``ndarray->data`` before calling ``Py_DECREF``. As mentioned above, the change
in size should not impact end-users.

Detailed description
--------------------

High level design
=================

Users who wish to change the NumPy data memory management routines will use
:c:func:`PyDataMem_SetHandler`, which uses a :c:type:`PyDataMem_Handler`
structure to hold pointers to functions used to manage the data memory.

Since a call to ``PyDataMem_SetHandler`` will change the default functions, but
that function may be called during the lifetime of an ``ndarray`` object, each
``ndarray`` will carry with it the ``PyDataMem_Handler`` struct used at the
time of its instantiation, and these will be used to reallocate or free the
data memory of the instance. Internally NumPy may use ``memcpy`` or ``memset``
on the pointer to the data memory.

NumPy C-API functions
=====================

.. c:type:: PyDataMem_Handler

    A struct to hold function pointers used to manipulate memory

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct {
            char name[128];  /* multiple of 64 to keep the struct unaligned */
            PyDataMem_AllocFunc *alloc;
            PyDataMem_ZeroedAllocFunc *zeroed_alloc;
            PyDataMem_FreeFunc *free;
            PyDataMem_ReallocFunc *realloc;
        } PyDataMem_Handler;

    where the function's signatures are

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef void *(PyDataMem_AllocFunc)(size_t size);
        typedef void *(PyDataMem_ZeroedAllocFunc)(size_t nelems, size_t elsize);
        typedef void (PyDataMem_FreeFunc)(void *ptr, size_t size);
        typedef void *(PyDataMem_ReallocFunc)(void *ptr, size_t size);

.. c:function:: const PyDataMem_Handler * PyDataMem_SetHandler(PyDataMem_Handler *handler)

   Sets a new allocation policy. If the input value is NULL, will reset
   the policy to the default. Returns the previous policy, NULL if the
   previous policy was the default. We wrap the user-provided functions
   so they will still call the Python and NumPy memory management callback
   hooks. All the function pointers must be filled in, NULL is not accepted.

.. c:function:: const char * PyDataMem_GetHandlerName(PyArrayObject *obj)

   Return the const char name of the ``PyDataMem_Handler`` used by the
   ``PyArrayObject``. If ``NULL``, return the name of the current global policy
   that will be used to allocate data for the next ``PyArrayObject``.


Sample code
===========

This code adds a 64-byte header to each ``data`` pointer and stores information
about the allocation in the header. Before calling ``free``, a check ensures
the ``sz`` argument is correct.

.. code-block:: c

        }

Related Work
------------

This NEP is being tracked by the pnumpy_ project and a `comment in the PR`_
mentions use in orchestrating FPGA DMAs.

Implementation
--------------

This NEP has been implemented in `PR  17582`_.

Alternatives
------------

These were discussed in `issue 17467`_. `PR 5457`_  and `PR 5470`_ proposed a
global interface for specifying aligned allocations.

``PyArray_malloc_aligned`` and friends were added to NumPy with the
`numpy.random` module API refactor. and are used there for performance.

`PR 390`_ had two parts: expose ``PyDataMem_*`` via the NumPy C-API, and a hook
mechanism. The PR was merged with no example code for using these features.

Discussion
----------

Not yet discussed on the mailing list.
