This file gives an overview of what is necessary to build binary releases for
NumPy on OS X. Windows binaries are built here using Wine, they can of course
also be built on Windows itself. Building OS X binaries on another platform is
not possible.

Current build and release info
==============================
The current info on building and releasing NumPy and SciPy is scattered in
several places. It should be summarized in one place, updated and where
necessary described in more detail. The sections below list all places where
useful info can be found.

Source tree
-----------
* INSTALL.txt
* release.sh
* pavement.py

NumPy Trac
----------
* http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/MakingReleases
* http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/MicrosoftToolchainSupport
* http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/ApiDeprecation

SciPy.org wiki
--------------
* http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy and links on that page.
* http://new.scipy.org/building/windows.html

Doc wiki
--------
* http://docs.scipy.org/numpy/docs/numpy-docs/user/install.rst/


Supported platforms and versions
================================
Python 2.4-2.6  are the currently supported versions on all platforms. 
NumPy 2.0 should include support for Python >=3.1.

OS X
----
OS X 10.4 (Tiger), 10.5 (Leopard) and 10.6 (Snow Leopard) are supported for the 1.4.x
releases. Note that only the Python from `python.org <http://python.org>`_ is
supported. Binaries do *not* support Apple Python.

Windows
-------
Windows XP and Windows Vista are supported by the 1.3.0 release, the 1.4.x
releases also support Windows 7.

Linux
-----
Many distributions include NumPy. Building from source is also relatively
straightforward. Only tarballs are created for Linux, no specific binary
installers are provided (yet).

BSD / Solaris
-------------
No binaries are provided, but succesful builds on Solaris and BSD have been
reported.


Tool chain
==========
Compilers
---------
The same gcc version is used as the one with which Python itself is built on
each platform. At the moment this means:

* OS X uses gcc 4.0
* Windows build uses latest released version from MinGW, now at 3.4.5.

Cython >= 0.12 is needed.

Fortran: on OS X gfortran from `this site <http://r.research.att.com/tools/>`_ 
is used. On Windows g77 (included in MinGW) is the current default, in the future 
this may shift to gfortran as well.

Python
------
* Python from `python.org <http://python.org>`_
* virtualenv
* paver
* bdist_mpkg
* `numpy-macosx-installer <http://github.com/cournape/numpy-macosx-installer>`_

Building docs
-------------
* Sphinx
* numpydoc
* Matplotlib
* Texlive (or MikTeX on Windows)

Wine
----
For building Windows binaries on OS X Wine can be used. In Wine the following
needs to be installed:

* Python 2.5
* Python 2.6
* MakeNsis
* CpuId plugin for MakeNsis : this can be found in the NumPy source tree under
  tools/win32build/cpucaps and has to be built with MinGW (see SConstruct file in 
  that dir for details)
* MinGW
* ATLAS, 3x ([No SSE, SSE2, SSE3] for superpack installer) : ATLAS does not
  compile under wine or on Windows out of the box. Binaries for ATLAS can be
  found in svn under vendor/.

To install Wine on OS X Snow Leopard the current options are to compile a
current unstable version ,`<http://wiki.winehq.org/MacOSX/Building>`_, or to use
an install script from `here <http://code.google.com/p/osxwinebuilder/>`_. For
me, the former option did not work (everything compiled, but after installing
Python the command ``import tempfile`` resulted in an exception. The latter
option did work.

After successful installation and an invocation of the wine executable, a
~/.wine folder exists - new programs will be installed there in
~/.wine/drive_c. Installing Windows programs with .exe executables is done by
running

  $ wine yourprog.exe

and MSI installers can be installed with

  $ msiexec /i yourprog.msi

For the above to work you probably need to put the wine-1.x.x/bin directory in
your PATH. 

To install MinGW, the easiest option is to use the automated installer on the
MinGW download page. This will give you (at this moment) GCC 3.4.5; GCC 4.x is
still not supported officially by MinGW.

To be able to use gcc and MakeNsis in Wine, the locations of gcc.exe and
makensis.exe should be added to the Windows environment variable PATH. This can
easily be done by running

  $ wine regedit

add adding a PATH variable in HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment.

Virtualenv
----------
Virtualenv is a very useful tool to keep several versions of packages around.
It is also used in the Paver script to build the docs. The use of the 
``--no-site-packages`` option in the Paver script is probably not necessary, 
and may prevent successful building of the docs. If doc building fails because
Matplotlib can not be found, remove this option.


What is released
================

Binaries
--------
Windows binaries in "superpack" form for Python 2.5 and 2.6. A superpack
contains three builds, for SSE2, SSE3 and no SSE.

OS X binaries are made in dmg format, targeting only the Python from
`python.org <http://python.org>`_

For Python 2.4 binaries are not built. It should be checked however
that the source release works with Python 2.4.

Other
-----
* Release Notes
* Changelog

Source distribution
-------------------
A source release in both .zip and .tar.gz formats is released.


Release process
===============

Check the buildbot
------------------
The buildbot is located at `<http://buildbot.scipy.org/>`_.

Make sure current trunk builds a package correctly
--------------------------------------------------
::

    python setup.py bdist
    python setup.py sdist

To actually build the binaries after everything is set up correctly, the
release.sh script can be used. For details of the build process itself it is
best to read the pavement.py script.

.. note:: The following steps are repeated for the beta(s), release
   candidates(s) and the final release.

Create the release "tag"
------------------------
::

    svn cp http://svn.scipy.org/svn/numpy/trunk http://svn.scipy.org/svn/numpy/tags/<version>

Update the version of the trunk
-------------------------------
Increment the release number in setup.py. Release candidates should have "rc1"
(or "rc2", "rcN") appended to the X.Y.Z format.

Update the version of the tag
-----------------------------
Switch to the tag::

  svn switch http://svn.scipy.org/svn/numpy/tags/<version>

Set ``release=True`` in setup.py. 

Make the release
----------------
The tar-files and binary releases for distribution should be uploaded to SourceForge, 
together with the Release Notes and the Changelog. Uploading can be done
through a web interface or, more efficiently, through scp/sftp/rsync as
described in the SourceForge 
`upload guide <https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Release%20files%20for%20download>`_.
For example::

  scp <filename> <username>,numpy@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/n/nu/numpy/NumPy/<releasedir>/ 

Update PyPi
-----------
There are two ways to update PyPi, the first one is::

  $ python setup.py sdist upload

and the second one is to upload the PKG_INFO file inside the sdist dir in the
web interface of PyPi. The source tarball can also be uploaded through this
interface. A simple binary installer for windows, created with
``bdist_wininst``, should also be uploaded to PyPi so ``easy_install numpy``
works.

Update scipy.org
----------------
A release announcement with a link to the download site should be placed in the
sidebar of the front page of scipy.org.

Announce to the lists 
---------------------
The release should be announced on the mailing lists of
NumPy and SciPy, and possibly also those of Matplotlib,IPython and/or Pygame.

During the beta/RC phase an explicit request for testing the binaries with
several other libraries (SciPy/Matplotlib/Pygame) should be posted on the
mailing list.
