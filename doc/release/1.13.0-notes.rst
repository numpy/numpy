Compatibility notes
===================

DeprecationWarning to error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See Changes section for more detail.

* ``partition``, TypeError when non-integer partition index is used.
* ``NpyIter_AdvancedNew``, ValueError when `oa_ndim == 0` and `op_axes` is NULL
* ``negative(bool_)``, TypeError when negative applied to booleans.
* ``subtract(bool_, bool_)``, TypeError when subtracting boolean from boolean.
* ``np.equal, np.not_equal``, object identity doesn't override failed comparison.
* ``np.equal, np.not_equal``, object identity doesn't override non-boolean comparison.

FutureWarning to changed behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See Changes section for more detail.

* ``numpy.average`` preserves subclasses
* ``array == None`` and ``array != None`` do element-wise comparison.
* ``np.equal, np.not_equal``, object identity doesn't override comparison result.

New Features
============

``axes`` argument for ``unique``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In an N-dimensional array, the user can now choose the axis along which to look
for duplicate N-1-dimensional elements using ``numpy.unique``. The original
behaviour is recovered if ``axis=None`` (default).


Improvements
============


Changes
=======

``average`` now preserves subclasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For ndarray subclasses, ``numpy.average`` will now return an instance of the
subclass, matching the behavior of most other numpy functions such as ``mean``.
As a consequence, also calls that returned a scalar may now return a subclass
array scalar.

``array == None`` and ``array != None`` do element-wise comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously these operations returned scalars ``False`` and ``True`` respectively.

``np.equal, np.not_equal`` for object arrays ignores object identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously, these functions always treated identical objects as equal. This had
the effect of overriding comparison failures, comparison of objects that did
not return booleans, such as np.arrays, and comparison of objects where the
results differed from object identity, such as NaNs.
