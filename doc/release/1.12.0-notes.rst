NumPy 1.12.0 Release Notes
**************************

This release supports Python 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.5.

Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============

* Support for Python 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3 has been dropped.


Future Changes
==============

* In 1.13 NAT will always compare False except for ``NAT != NAT``,
  which will be True.  In short, NAT will behave like NaN


Compatibility notes
===================

DeprecationWarning to error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Indexing with floats raises ``IndexError``,
  e.g., a[0, 0.0].
* Indexing with non-integer array_like raises ``IndexError``,
  e.g., ``a['1', '2']``
* Indexing with multiple ellipsis raises ``IndexError``,
  e.g., ``a[..., ...]``.
* Non-integers used as index values raise ``TypeError``,
  e.g., in ``reshape``, ``take``, and specifying reduce axis.

Relaxed stride checking is the default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will have some impact on code that assumed that ``F_CONTIGUOUS`` and
``C_CONTIGUOUS`` were mutually exclusive and could be set to determine the
default order for arrays that are now both.

``MaskedArray`` takes view of data **and** mask when slicing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XXX


``np.percentile`` 'midpoint' interpolation method fixed for exact indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'midpoint' interpolator now gives the same result as 'lower' and 'higher' when
the two coincide. Previous behavior of 'lower' + 0.5 is fixed.


``keepdims`` kwarg is passed through to user-class methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

numpy functions that take a ``keepdims`` kwarg now pass the value
through to the corresponding methods on ndarray sub-classes.  Previously the
``keepdims`` keyword would be silently dropped.  These functions now have
the following behavior:

1. If user does not provide ``keepdims``, no keyword is passed to the underlying
   method.
2. Any user-provided value of ``keepdims`` is passed through as a keyword
   argument to the method.

This will raise in the case where the method does not support a
``keepdims`` kwarg and the user explicitly passes in ``keepdims``.


The following functions are changed: ``sum``, ``product``,
``sometrue``, ``alltrue``, ``any``, ``all``, ``amax``, ``amin``,
``prod``, ``mean``, ``std``, ``var``, ``nanmin``, ``nanmax``,
``nansum``, ``nanprod``, ``nanmean``, ``nanmedian``, ``nanvar``,
``nanstd``

``bitwise_and`` identity changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The previous identity was 1, it is now -1. See entry in `Improvements`_ for
more explanation.

FutureWarning to changed behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``np.full`` now returns an array of the fill-value's dtype if no dtype is
  given, instead of defaulting to float.

C API

New Features
============

Writeable keyword argument for ``as_strided``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided`` now has a ``writeable``
keyword argument. It can be set to False when no write operation
to the returned array is expected to avoid accidental
unpredictable writes.

Generalized ``flip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``flipud`` and ``fliplr`` reverse the elements of an array along axis=0 and
axis=1 respectively. The newly added ``flip`` function reverses the elements of
an array along any given axis.


BLIS support in ``numpy.distutils``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building against the BLAS implementation provided by the BLIS library is now
supported.  See the ``[blis]`` section in ``site.cfg.example`` (in the root of
the numpy repo or source distribution).

Hook in ``numpy/__init__.py`` to run distribution-specific checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Binary distributions of numpy may need to run specific hardware checks or load
specific libraries during numpy initialization.  For example, if we are
distributing numpy with a BLAS library that requires SSE2 instructions, we
would like to check the machine on which numpy is running does have SSE2 in
order to give an informative error.

Add a hook in ``numpy/__init__.py`` to import a ``numpy/_distributor_init.py``
file that will remain empty (bar a docstring) in the standard numpy source,
but that can be overwritten by people making binary distributions of numpy.

New nanfunctions ``nancumsum`` and ``nancumprod`` added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nanfunctions ``nancumsum`` and ``nancumprod`` have been added to
compute ``cumsum`` and ``cumprod`` by ignoring nans.

Improvements
============

``np.loadtxt`` now supports a single integer as ``usecol`` argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of using ``usecol=(n,)`` to read the nth column of a file
it is now allowed to use ``usecol=n``. Also the error message is
more user friendly when a non-integer is passed as a column index.

Improved automated bin estimators for ``histogram``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'doane' and 'sqrt' estimators to ``histogram`` via the ``bins``
argument. Added support for range-restricted histograms with automated
bin estimation.

``bitwise_and`` identity changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The previous identity was 1 with the result that all bits except the LSB were
masked out when the reduce method was used.  The new identity is -1, which
should work properly on twos complement machines as all bits will be set to
one.

Generalized Ufuncs will now unlock the GIL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generalized Ufuncs, including most of the linalg module, will now unlock
the Python global interpreter lock.

np.roll can now roll multiple axes at the same time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``shift`` and ``axis`` arguments to ``roll`` are now broadcast against each
other, and each specified axis is shifted accordingly.

The *__complex__* method has been implemented on the ndarray object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calling ``complex()`` on a size 1 array will now cast to a python
complex.

``pathlib.Path`` objects now supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The standard ``np.load``, ``np.save``, ``np.loadtxt``, ``np.savez``, and similar
functions can now take ``pathlib.Path`` objects as an argument instead of a
filename or open file object.


Changes
=======

All array-like methods are now called with keyword arguments in fromnumeric.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Internally, many array-like methods in fromnumeric.py were being called with
positional arguments instead of keyword arguments as their external signatures
were doing. This caused a complication in the downstream 'pandas' library
that encountered an issue with 'numpy' compatibility. Now, all array-like
methods in this module are called with keyword arguments instead.

Operations on np.memmap objects return numpy arrays in most cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously operations on a memmap (e.g. adding 1 to it) object would
misleadingly return a memmap instance even if the result was actually
not memmapped. Also reduction of a memmap (e.g.  ``.sum(axis=None``)
return a numpy scalar instead of a 0d memmap.

Deprecations
============

Assignment of ndarray object's ``data`` attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assigning the 'data' attribute is an inherently unsafe operation as pointed
out in gh-7083. Such a capability will be removed in the future.

Unsafe int casting of the num attribute in ``linspace``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``np.linspace`` now raises DeprecationWarning when num cannot be safely
interpreted as an integer.

Insufficient bit width parameter to ``binary_repr``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a 'width' parameter is passed into ``binary_repr`` that is insufficient to
represent the number in base 2 (positive) or 2's complement (negative) form,
the function used to silently ignore the parameter and return a representation
using the minimal number of bits needed for the form in question. Such behavior
is now considered unsafe from a user perspective and will raise an error in the future.
