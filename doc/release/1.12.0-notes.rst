NumPy 1.12.0 Release Notes
**************************

This release supports Python 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.5.

Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============

* Support for Python 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3 has been dropped.


Future Changes
==============

* In 1.13 NAT will always compare False except for ``NAT != NAT``,
  which will be True.  In short, NAT will behave like NaN


Compatibility notes
===================

Relaxed stride checking is the default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will have some impact on code that assumed that ``F_CONTIGUOUS`` and
``C_CONTIGUOUS`` were mutually exclusive and could be set to determine the
default order for arrays that are now both.

``MaskedArray`` takes view of data **and** mask when slicing
