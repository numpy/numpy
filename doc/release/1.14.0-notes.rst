Future Changes
==============


Build System Changes
====================


Compatibility notes
===================

``np.tensordot`` now returns zero array when contracting over 0-length dimension
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``np.tensordot`` raised a ValueError when contracting over 0-length
dimension. Now it returns a zero array, which is consistent with the behaviour
of ``np.dot`` and ``np.einsum``.

``np.ma`` functions producing ``fill_value``s have changed
----------------------------------------------------------
Previously, ``np.ma.default_fill_value`` would return a 0d array, but
``np.ma.minimum_fill_value`` and ``np.ma.maximum_fill_value`` would return a
tuple of the fields. Instead, all three methods return a structured ``np.void``
object, which is what you would already find in the ``.fill_value`` attribute.

Additionally, the dtype guessing now matches that of ``np.array`` - so when
passing a python scalar ``x``, ``maximum_fill_value(x)`` is always the same as
``maximum_fill_value(np.array(x))``. Previously ``x = long(1)`` on Python 2
violated this assumption.


C API changes
=============


New Features
============

`numpy.testing.Tester` is now aware of ``nose`` plugins that are outside the
built-in ones in ``nose``.  This allows using for example ``nose-timer`` like
so:  ``np.test(extra_argv=['--with-timer', '--timer-top-n', '20'])`` to
obtain the runtime of the 20 slowest tests.  An extra keyword ``timer`` was
also added to ``Tester.test``, so ``np.test(timer=20)`` will also report the 20
slowest tests.


Improvements
============

GIL released for all ``np.einsum`` variations
---------------------------------------------

Some specific loop structures which have an accelerated loop version
did not release the GIL prior to NumPy 1.14.0.  This oversight has been
fixed.

``MaskedArray.astype`` takes all the same arguments as ``ndarray.astype
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This makes more code written for ndarray work for masked array too


Changes
=======

0d arrays now print their elements like other arrays
----------------------------------------------------
0d arrays now use the array2string formatters to print their elements, like
other arrays. The `style` argument of array2string is now non-functional.

integer scalars are now unaffected by ``np.set_string_function``
----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously the str/repr of integer scalars could be controlled by
``np.set_string_function``, unlike most other numpy scalars. This is no longer
the case.
