Runtime signature introspection support has been significantly improved
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Many NumPy functions, classes, and methods that previously raised ``ValueError`` when passed
to ``inspect.signature()`` now return meaningful signatures. This improves support for runtime type
checking, IDE autocomplete, documentation generation, and runtime introspection capabilities across
the NumPy API.

Over three hundred classes and functions have been updated in total, including, but not limited to,
core classes such as `ndarray`, `generic`, `dtype`, `ufunc`, `broadcast`, `nditer`, etc.,
most methods of `ndarray` and scalar types, array constructor functions (`array`, `empty`,
`arange`, `fromiter`, etc.), and many other commonly used functions, including `dot`, `concat`,
`where`, `bincount`, `can_cast`, and numerous others.
