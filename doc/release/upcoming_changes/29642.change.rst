Sorting ``kind='heapsort'`` now maps to ``kind='quicksort'``
------------------------------------------------------------
It is unlikely that this change will be noticed, but if you do see a change in
execution time or unstable argsort order, that is likely the cause. Please let
us know if there is a performance regression. Congratulate us if it is
improved :)
