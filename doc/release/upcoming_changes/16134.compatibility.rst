Same kind casting in concatenate with ``axis=None``
---------------------------------------------------
When `~numpy.concatenate` is called with `axis=None`,
the flattened arrays were cast with ``unsafe``. Any other axis
choice uses "same kind". That different default
has been deprecated and "same kind" casting will be used
instead. The new ``casting`` keyword argument
can be used to retain the old behaviour.
