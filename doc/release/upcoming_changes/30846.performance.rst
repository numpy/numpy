Improved scaling of ufuncs on free-threading
--------------------------------------------

NumPy's ufuncs now scale significantly better on free-threading builds
of CPython due to the following optimizations:

* **Lock-free dispatch table:** The ufuncs dispatch table is now
  implemented as a lock-free concurrent hash map, allowing multiple threads
  to call ufuncs without contention.

* **Immortal shared objects:** Certain shared objects, such as global memory
  handlers, have been made immortal. This effectively reduces reference
  counting contention across threads.

* **Optimized memory allocation:** NumPy now utilizes ``PyMem_RawMalloc`` and
  ``PyMem_RawFree`` for memory allocation. On Python 3.15 and newer, this
  leverages ``mimalloc`` and significantly reduces memory allocation overhead
  in multi-threaded workloads.
