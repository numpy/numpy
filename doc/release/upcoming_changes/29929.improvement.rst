For ``f2py``, the behaviour of ``intent(inplace)`` has improved.
Previously, if an input array did not have the right dtype or order,
the input array was modified in-place, changing its dtype and
replacing its data by a corrected copy.  Now, instead, the corrected
copy is kept a separate array, which, after being passed and
presumably modified by the fortran routine, is copied back to the
input routine.  The above means one no longer has the risk that
pre-existing views or slices of the input array start pointing to
unallocated memory (at the price of increased overhead for the
write-back copy at the end of the call).

A potential problem would be that one might get very different results
if one, e.g., previously passed in an integer array where a double
array was expected: the writeback to integer would likely give wrong
results.  To avoid such situations, ``intent(inplace)`` will now only
allow arrays that have equivalent type to that used in the fortran
routine, i.e., ``dtype.kind`` is the same. For instance, a routine
expecting double would be able to receive float, but would raise on
integer input.
