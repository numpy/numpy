Deprecation of the ``generic`` unit in `numpy.timedelta64` and `numpy.datetime64`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``generic`` unit in `numpy.timedelta64` and `numpy.datetime64` is now
deprecated. This unit can lead to unexpected behavior in some cases
(see #28287 for details).  

As an alternative, please specify an explicit unit such as ``'s'`` (seconds)
or ``'D'`` (days) when constructing `numpy.timedelta64` or `numpy.datetime64`.
