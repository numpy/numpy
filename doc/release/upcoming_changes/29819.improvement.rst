Performance increase for scalar calculations
--------------------------------------------
The speed of calculations on scalars has been improved by about a factor 6 for
ufuncs that take only one input (like ``np.sin(scalar)``), reducing the speed
difference from their ``math`` equivalents from a factor 19 to 3 (the speed
for arrays is left unchanged).
