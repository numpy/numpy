``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` now does not support scalar types
----------------------------------------------------------------
The function ``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` has been updated to only accept ``numpy.ndarray``.
Passing a scalar type (e.g., ``numpy.int32(5)``) will now raise a ``TypeError``.
This change was made to avoid the issue `gh-30354 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/30354>`__
and to enforce the readonly nature of scalar types in NumPy.
Users who need to convert scalar types to ctypes should first convert them to an array
(e.g., ``numpy.asarray``) before passing them to ``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes``.
