``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` now does not support scalar types
----------------------------------------------------------------
The function ``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` has been updated to only accept ``numpy.ndarray``.
Passing a scalar type (e.g., ``numpy.int32(5)``) will now raise a ``TypeError``.
This change was made to avoid the issue `gh-30354 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/30354>`__
and to enforce the readonly nature of scalar types in NumPy.
The previous behavior relied on undocumented implicit temporary arrays and was not well-defined.
Users who need to convert scalar types to ctypes should first convert them to an array
(e.g., ``numpy.asarray``) before passing them to ``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes``.


``__ref`` value in ``__array_interface__`` for scalar types is removed
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously, scalar types in NumPy had a ``__ref`` entry in their ``__array_interface__``
dictionary, which pointed to the temporary array created to hold the scalar value.
This behavior has been removed to avoid the issue `gh-30354 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/30354>`__.
Now, scalar types will not have a ``__ref`` entry in their ``__array_interface__``.
Instead, ``data`` entry in ``__array_interface__`` will directly point to the memory location of the scalar value and
will be marked as readonly.
