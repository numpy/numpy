``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` now does not support scalar types
----------------------------------------------------------------
The function ``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`` has been updated to only accept ``numpy.ndarray``.
Passing a scalar type (e.g., ``numpy.int32(5)``) will now raise a ``TypeError``.
This change was made to avoid the issue `gh-30354 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/30354>`__
and to enforce the readonly nature of scalar types in NumPy.
The previous behavior relied on undocumented implicit temporary arrays and was not well-defined.
Users who need to convert scalar types to ctypes should first convert them to an array
(e.g., ``numpy.asarray``) before passing them to ``numpy.ctypeslib.as_ctypes``.


``__array_interface__`` changes on scalars
------------------------------------------
Scalars now export the ``__array_interface__`` directly rather than including
an array copy as a ``__ref`` entry. This means that scalars are now exported
as read-only while they previously exported as writeable.
The path via ``__ref`` was undocumented and not consistently used even
within NumPy itself.
