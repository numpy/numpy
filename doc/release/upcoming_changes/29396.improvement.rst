Show unit information in ``__repr__`` for ``datetime64("NaT")``
------------------------------------------------------------------
When a `datetime64` object is "Not a Time" (NaT), its ``__repr__`` method now
includes the time unit of the datetime64 type. This makes it consistent with
the behavior of a `timedelta64` object.
