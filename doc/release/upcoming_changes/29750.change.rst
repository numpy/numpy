The ``npymath`` and ``npyrandom`` libraries now have a ``.lib`` rather than a
``.a`` file extension on win-arm64, for compatibility for building with MSVC and
``setuptools``. Please note that using these static libraries is discouraged
and for existing projects using it, it's best to use it with a matching
compiler toolchain, which is ``clang-cl`` on Windows on Arm.
