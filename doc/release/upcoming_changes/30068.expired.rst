``numpy.array2string`` and ``numpy.sum`` deprecations finalized
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following long-deprecated APIs have been removed or converted to errors:

* The ``style`` parameter has been removed from ``numpy.array2string``.
  This argument had no effect since Numpy 1.14.0.

* Calling ``np.sum(generator)`` directly on a generator object now raises a `TypeError`.
  This behavior was deprecated in NumPy 1.15.0. Use ``np.sum(np.fromiter(generator))``
  or the python ``sum`` builtin instead.
