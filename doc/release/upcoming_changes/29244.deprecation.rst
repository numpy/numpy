Setting the ``dtype`` attribute is deprecated
---------------------------------------------
Setting the dtype attribute is now deprecated since mutating
an array is unsafe if an array is shared, especially by multiple
threads.  As an alternative, you can create a view with a new dtype
via `array.view(dtype=new_dtype)`.
