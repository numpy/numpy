Add options to quiet build configuration and build with ``-Werror``
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Added two new configuration options. During the ``build_src`` subcommand, as
part of configuring NumPy, the files ``_numpyconfig.h`` and ``config.h`` are
created by probing support for various runtime functions and routines.
Previously, the very verbose compiler output during this stage clouded more
important information. By default the output is silenced. Running ``runtests.py
--debug-info`` will add ``--verbose-cfg`` to the ``build_src`` subcommand,
which will restore the previous behaviour.

Adding ``CFLAGS=-Werror`` to turn warnings into errors would trigger errors
during the configuration. Now ``runtests.py --warn-error`` will add
``--warn-error`` to the ``build`` subcommand, which will percolate to the
``build_ext`` and ``build_lib`` subcommands. This will add the compiler flag
to those stages and turn compiler warnings into errors while actually building
NumPy itself, avoiding the ``build_src`` subcommand compiler calls.
