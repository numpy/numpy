``np.unique`` with ``return_index`` now returns correct indices for complex NaN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug where `numpy.unique` with ``return_index=True`` and
``equal_nan=True`` would not return the index of the first occurrence of NaN
values in complex arrays. Previously, after sorting, it would return the index
of the first NaN in the sorted order rather than the first NaN in the original
array order. The function now correctly returns the index of the first NaN
occurrence in the input array.
