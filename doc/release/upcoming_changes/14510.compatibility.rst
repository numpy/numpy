`numpy.lib.recfunctions.drop_fields` can no longer return None
--------------------------------------------------------------
If ``drop_fields`` is used to drop all fields, previously the array would
be completely discarded and None returned. Now it returns an array of the
same shape as the input, but with no fields. The old behavior can be retained
with::

    dropped_arr = drop_fields(arr, ['a', 'b'])
    if dropped_arr.dtype.names == ():
        dropped_arr = None

converting the empty recarray to None
