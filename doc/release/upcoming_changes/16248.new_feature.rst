Digitize Keyword Egde
---------------------
A keyword argument has been added to `np.digitize` so that the
edge case is covered in the last bin. For example::

	x = [1, 2, 3]
	bins = [0, 1.5, 3]

``np.digitize(x, bins, right=False, edge=True)`` yields ``[1, 2, 2]``
whereas before the edge keyword argument existed it would yield
``[1, 2, 3]``.
