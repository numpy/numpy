`numpy.fix` is deprecated
-------------------------
The `numpy.fix` function is deprecated and will be removed in a future version
of NumPy. Use `numpy.trunc` instead, which provides identical functionality.
Both functions round towards zero (truncate), but `numpy.trunc` is the standard
name used across NumPy and other numerical libraries.
