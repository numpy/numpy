``numpy.where`` no longer truncates Python integers
---------------------------------------------------

Previously, if the ``x`` or ``y`` argument of ``numpy.where`` was a Python integer
that was out of range of the output type, it would be silently truncated.
Now, an `OverflowError` will be raised instead.

This change also applies to the underlying C API function ``PyArray_Where``.
