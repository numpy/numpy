Correct behaviour for ``np.genfromtxt`` 
---------------------------------------
Earlier, whenever ``usecols`` had all the column names present in
``fname`` (data), but in different order, columns would not match its
names.
Now, the name assignment is well done, even if names in ``usecols`` are
out of order.
