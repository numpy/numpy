``np.find_common_type`` is deprecated
-------------------------------------
`numpy.find_common_type` is now deprecated and its use should be replaced
with either `numpy.result_type` or `numpy.promote_types`.
Most users leave the second ``scalar_types`` argument to ``find_common_type``
as ``[]`` in which case ``np.result_type`` and ``np.promote_types`` are both
faster and more robust.
When not using ``scalar_types`` the only difference is that the replacement
intentionally converts non-native byte-order to native byte order.

When the ``scalar_types`` argument is not ``[]`` things are more complicated.
In most cases, using ``np.result_type`` and passing the Python values
``0``, ``0.0``, or ``0j`` has the same result as using ``int``, ``float``,
or ``complex`` in `scalar_types`.

When ``scalar_types`` is constructed, ``np.result_type`` is the
correct replacement and it may be passed scalar values like ``np.float32(0.0)``.
Passing values other than 0, may lead to value-inspecting behavior
(which ``np.find_common_type`` never used and NEP 50 may change in the future).
The main possible change in behavior in this case, is when the array types
are signed integers and scalar types are unsigned.

If you are unsure about how to replace an a use of ``scalar_types``, please
do not hesitate to open a NumPy issue.
