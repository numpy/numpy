Rewrite of `np.ndindex` using `itertools.product`
--------------------------------------------------
The `numpy.ndindex` function now uses `itertools.product` internally, 
providing significant improvements in both performance and memory efficiency,
particularly for large iteration spaces, while maintaining the original behavior and interface.
For example, for a (50, 60, 90) array, this results in a 5.2Ã— speedup on average, 
with memory usage significantly reduced thanks to on-the-fly index generation.
