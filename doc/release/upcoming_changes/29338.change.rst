``__array_interface__`` with NULL pointer changed
-------------------------------------------------
The array interface now accepts NULL pointers (NumPy will do
its own dummy allocation, though).
Previously, these incorrectly triggered an undocumented
scalar path.
In the unlikely event that the scalar path was actually desired,
you can (for now) achieve the previous behavior via the correct
scalar path by not providing a ``data`` field at all.
