``unique_values`` for float and complex dtypes may return unsorted data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
np.unique now supports hash‐based duplicate removal for float and complex dtypes.
This enhancement extends the hash‐table algorithm to all floating types
('f'), complex types ('c'), and their extended precision variants.
The hash‐based method provides faster extraction of unique values
but does not guarantee that the result will be sorted.
