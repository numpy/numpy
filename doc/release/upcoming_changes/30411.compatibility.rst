* `linalg.eig` and `linalg.eigvals` always return complex arrays. Previously, the return
   values were depening on whether the eigenvalues happen to lie on the real line (which, for
   a general, non-symmetric matrix, is not guaranteed).

   The user change depends on your usage:

   - to retain the previous behavior, do

   ```
   w = eigvals(a)
   if w.imag == 0:    # this is what NumPy used to do
   w = w.real
   ```

   - if your matrix is symmetrix/hermitian, use `eigh` and `eigvalsh` instead of `eig` and `eigvals`:
     these are guaranteed to return real values. (A common case is covariance matrices, which are
     symmetric and positive definite by construction)
