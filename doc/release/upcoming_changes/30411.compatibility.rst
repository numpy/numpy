``linalg.eig`` and ``linalg.eigvals`` now always return complex arrays
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, the return values depended on whether the eigenvalues happen to lie
on the real line (which, for a general, non-symmetric matrix, is not guaranteed).

The change makes consistent what was a value-dependent result. To retain the
previous behavior, do::

   w = eigvals(a)
   if np.any(w.imag == 0):  # this is what NumPy used to do
       w = w.real

If your matrix is symmetrix/hermitian, use ``eigh`` and ``eigvalsh`` instead of
``eig`` and ``eigvals``. These are guaranteed to return real values. A common
case is covariance matrices, which are symmetric and positive definite by
construction.
