``numpy.ndarray.tostring()`` is deprecated in favor of ``tobytes()``
--------------------------------------------------------------------
`~numpy.ndarray.tobytes` has existed since the 1.9 release, but until this
release `~numpy.ndarray.tostring` emitted no warning. The change to emit a
warning brings NumPy in line with the builtin `array.array` methods of the
same name.
