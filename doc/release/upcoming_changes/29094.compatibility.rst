The Macro NPY_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED has been removed
-------------------------------------------------
The macro was defined in the `npy_cpu.h` file, so might be regarded as
semipublic. As it turns out, with modern compilers and hardware it is almost
always the case that alignment is required, so numpy no longer uses the macro.
It is unlikely anyone uses it, but you might want to compile with the `-Wundef`
flag or equivalent to be sure.
