Fix power of complex zero
-------------------------
``np.power`` now returns a different result for ``0^{non-zero}``
for complex numbers.  Note that the value is only defined when
the real part of the exponent is larger than zero.
Previously, NaN was returned unless the imaginary part was strictly
zero.  Now a zero value is returned, with the sign bit
set.  The return value is either ``0+0j`` or ``0-0j``.
