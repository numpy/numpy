``memmap`` objects are now pickled using their metadata
-------------------------------------------------------

When pickling a ``memmap`` provided it has a filename, it will now be reconstructed
specifically as a ``memmap`` using the filename and other metadata.
Previously, ``memmap`` objects were pickled as standard arrays (recovering the
data, but not the memory map). This change allows for efficient sharing of
large arrays across processes without copying, but it also means that the
pickled file is no longer self-contained: the backing file must exist and be 
accessible when unpickling.
