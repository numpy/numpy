Functions that returned a list of ndarrays have been changed to return a tuple
of ndarrays instead. Returning tuples consistently whenever a sequence of
arrays is returned makes it easier for JIT compilers like Numba, as well as for
static type checkers in some cases, to support these functions. Changed
functions are: ``atleast_1d``, ``atleast_2d``, ``atleast_3d``, ``broadcast_arrays``,
``array_split``, ``split``, ``hsplit``, ``vsplit``, ``dsplit``, ``meshgrid``,
``ogrid``, ``histogramdd``.
