New ``__numpy_dtype__`` protocol
--------------------------------
NumPy now has a new ``__numpy_dtype__`` protocol. NumPy will check
for this attribute when converting to a NumPy dtype via ``np.dtype(obj)``
or any ``dtype=`` argument.

Downstream projects are encouraged to implement this for all dtype like
objects which may previously have used a ``.dtype`` attribute that returned
a NumPy dtype.
We expect to deprecate ``.dtype`` in the future to prevent interpreting
array-like objects with a ``.dtype`` attribute as a dtype.
If you wish you can implement ``__numpy_dtype__`` to ensure an earlier
warning or error (``.dtype`` is ignored if this is found).
