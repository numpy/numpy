New ``__numpy_dtype__`` protocol
--------------------------------
NumPy now has a new ``__numpy_dtype__`` protocol. NumPy will check
for this attribute when converting to a NumPy dtype via ``np.dtype(obj)``
or any ``dtype=`` argument.

Downstream projects are encouraged to implement this for all dtype like
objects which may previously have used a ``.dtype`` attribute that returned
a NumPy dtype.
For array-like objects we encourage you to implement ``__numpy_dtype__``
with a warning or error to _prevent_ using e.g. ``dtype=dataframe`` in
NumPy functions (it may be good to go via a Deprecation).
We expect deprecating coercion via ``.dtype`` in the future.
