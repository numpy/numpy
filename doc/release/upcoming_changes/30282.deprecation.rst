in-place modification of ``ndarray.shape`` is pending deprecation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Setting the `ndarray.shape` attribute directly will be deprecated in a future release.
Instead of modifying the shape in place, it is recommended to use the `numpy.reshape` function.
Static type checkers might already report a warning for assignments to `ndarray.shape`.
