Performance improvements to ``np.unique`` for float and complex dtypes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The hash-based algorithm for unique extraction now also supports float
and complex dtypes, offering noticeable performance gains.

In an internal benchmark with 5 billion float64 elements (1,000 unique values),
the hash-based ``np.unique`` completed in **406.9 seconds**,
compared to **441.8 seconds** with the sort-based method.

For complex128 arrays with 1 billion elements (1,000 unique values),
the hash-based method completed in **11.4 seconds**, compared to **47.4 seconds**
with the sort-based method – a more than 4× speedup for unsorted unique
operations on complex numbers.
