Performance improvements to ``np.unique`` for complex dtypes
------------------------------------------------------------
The hash-based algorithm for unique extraction now also supports
complex dtypes, offering noticeable performance gains.

In our benchmarks on complex128 arrays with 200,000 elements,
the hash-based approach was about 1.4–1.5× faster
than the sort-based baseline when there were 20% of unique values,
and about 5× faster when there were 0.2% of unique values.
