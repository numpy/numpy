``np.fix`` is pending deprecation
---------------------------------
The `numpy.fix` function will be deprecated in a future release. It is recommended to use
`numpy.trunc` instead, as it provides the same functionality of truncating decimal values to their
integer parts. Static type checkers might already report a warning for the use of `numpy.fix`.
