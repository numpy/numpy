Setting the ``shape`` attribute is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------
Setting the shape attribute is now deprecated since mutating
an array is unsafe if an array is shared, especially by multiple
threads.  As an alternative, you can create a new view via
`np.reshape` or `array.reshape`. For example: `x = np.arange(15); x = np.reshape(x, (3, 5))`.
