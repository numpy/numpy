Setting the ``shape`` attribute is deprecated
---------------------------------------------
Setting the shape attribute is now deprecated since mutating
an array is unsafe if an array is shared, especially by multiple
threads.  As an alternative, you can create a new view via
`np.reshape` or `np.ndarray.reshape`. For example: ``x = np.arange(15); x = np.reshape(x, (3, 5))``.
To ensure no copy is made from the data, one can use ``np.reshape(..., copy = False)``.

Directly setting the shape on an array is possible with the private method `np.ndarray._set_shape`.
