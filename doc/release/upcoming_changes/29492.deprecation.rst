Setting the ``shape`` attribute is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------
Setting the shape attribute is now deprecated since mutating
an array is unsafe if an array is shared, especially by multiple
threads.  As an alternative, you can create a new view (no copy) via
`np.reshape` or `array.reshape`.
