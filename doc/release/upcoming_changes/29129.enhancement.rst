``'same_value'`` for casting by value
-------------------------------------
The ``casting`` kwarg now has a ``'same_value'`` option that checks the actual
values can be round-trip cast without changing value. Currently it is only
implemented in `ndarray.astype`. This will raise a ``ValueError`` if any of the
values in the array would change as a result of the cast, including rounding of
floats or overflowing of ints.
