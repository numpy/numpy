Raise `TypeError` on attempt to convert array with `ndim > 0` to scalar
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversion of an array with `ndim > 0` to a scalar was deprecated in
NumPy 1.25.  Now, attempting to do so raises `TypeError`.
Ensure you extract a single element from your array before performing
this operation.
