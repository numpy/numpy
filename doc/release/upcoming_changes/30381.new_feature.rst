Pixi package definitions
------------------------
Pixi package definitions have been added for different kinds
of from-source builds of NumPy. These can be used in
downstream Pixi workspaces via the ``pixi-build`` feature.

Definitions for both ``default`` and AddressSanitizer-instrumented
(``asan``) builds are available in the source code under the
``pixi-packages/`` directory.

``linux-64`` and ``osx-arm64`` platforms are supported.
