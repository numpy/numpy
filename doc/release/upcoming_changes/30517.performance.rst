Improved performance of ``numpy.searchsorted``
----------------------------------------------
The C++ binary search implementation used by ``numpy.searchsorted`` now has
a much better performance when searching for multiple keys. The new
implementation batches binary search steps across all keys to leverage cache
locality and out-of-order execution. Benchmarks show the new implementation can
be up to 20 times faster for hundreds of thousands keys while single-key
performance remains comparable to previous versions.
