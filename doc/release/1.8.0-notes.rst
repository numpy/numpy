NumPy 1.8.0 Release Notes
*************************

This release supports  Python 2.6 -2.7 and 3.2 - 3.3.


Highlights
==========

Dropped Support
===============

Support for Python versions 2.4 and 2.5 has been dropped,

Support for SCons has been removed.


Compatibility notes
===================

numpy.diag, np.diagonal, and the diagonal method of ndarrays return a view
onto the original array, instead of producing a copy.

selecting multiple fields out of an array also produces a view.

The hash function of numpy.void scalars has been changed.  Previously the
pointer to the data was hashed as an integer.  Now, the hash function uses
the tuple-hash algorithm to combine the hash functions of the elements of
the scalar, but only if the scalar is read-only.

Numpy has switched its build system to using 'separate compilation' by
default.  In previous releases this was supported, but not default. This
should produce the same results as the old system, but if you're trying to
do something complicated like link numpy statically or using an unusual
compiler, then it's possible you will encounter problems. If so, please
file a bug and as a temporary workaround you can re-enable the old build
system by exporting the shell variable NPY_SEPARATE_COMPILATION=0.

For the AdvancedNew iterator the ``oa_ndim`` flag should now be -1 to indicate
that no ``op_axes`` and ``itershape`` are passed in. The ``oa_ndim == 0``
case, now indicates a 0-D iteration and ``op_axes`` being NULL and the old
usage is deprecated. This does not effect the ``NpyIter_New`` or
``NpyIter_MultiNew`` functions.


New Features
============

New constant
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Euler's constant is now exposed in numpy as euler_gamma.

New modes for qr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New modes 'complete', 'reduced', and 'raw' have been added to the qr
factorization and the old 'full' and 'economic' modes are deprecated.
The 'reduced' mode replaces the old 'full' mode and is the default as was
the 'full' mode, so backward compatibility can be maintained by not
specifying the mode.

The 'complete' mode returns a full dimensional factorization, which can be
useful for obtaining a basis for the orthogonal complement of the range
space. The 'raw' mode returns arrays that contain the Householder
reflectors and scaling factors that can be used in the future to apply q
without needing to convert to a matrix. The 'economic' mode is simply
deprecated, there isn't much use for it and it isn't any more efficient
than the 'raw' mode.

New `invert` argument to `in1d`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function `in1d` now accepts a `invert` argument which, when `True`,
causes the returned array to be inverted.

C-API
~~~~~

Changes
=======

General
~~~~~~~

The function np.take now allows 0-d arrays as indices.

The separate compilation mode is now enabled by default.

The functions np.insert and np.delete now handle out of bound indices like
normal indexing instead of ignoring them, this strongly affects negative ones.
FutureWarnings will be raised for boolean indices which will change behaviour.
Insert allows multiple insertions at single scalar since numpy 1.7. and now
further allows this for a one item sequence. There are subtle differences
because the scalar expects N arrays, while the sequence expects size N along
the axis.

C-API
~~~~~

Deprecations
============

The 'full' and 'economic' modes of qr factorization are deprecated.

General
~~~~~~~

Use of non-integer indices has been deprecated. Previously float indices
were truncated to integers without warning.
