NumPy 1.14.1 Release Notes
==========================

This is a bugfix release for some problems found since 1.14.0. The most
important fixes are the reversion of the multifield index "view" behavior (see
compatibility notes), and fixes to the spacing in the str and repr of complex
values.

The Python versions supported are 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.6. The Python 3.6 wheels
available from PIP are built with Python 3.6.2 and should be compatible with
all previous versions of Python 3.6. It was cythonized with Cython 0.26.1,
which should be free of the bugs found in 0.27 while also being compatible with
Python 3.7-dev.


Compatibility notes
===================

Multifield Indexing of Structured Arrays will still return a copy
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We have reverted the change in 1.14.0 that multi-field indexing of structured
arrays returns a view instead of a copy, and pushed it back to 1.15. This will
give us time to implement additional related bugfixes to ease the transition.
Affected users should read the the 1.14.1 Numpy User Guide for advice on how to
manage this transition, under "basics/structured arrays/accessing multiple
fields". A new method `numpy.lib.recfunctions.repack_fields` has been
introduced to help with this.  All other changes to structured arrays described
in the 1.14.0 release notes still hold in 1.14.1, and have not been reverted.
