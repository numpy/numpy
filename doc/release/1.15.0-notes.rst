==========================
NumPy 1.15.0 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights
==========


New functions
=============

* `np.gcd` and `np.lcm`, to compute the greatest common divisor and least
  common multiple.
* `np.ma.stack`, the `np.stack` array-joining function generalized to masked
  arrays.

* `np.printoptions`, the context manager which sets print options temporarily
  for the scope of the ``with`` block::

    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=2):
    ...     print(np.array([2.0])) / 3
    [0.67]

  * `np.histogram_bin_edges`, a function to get the edges of the bins used by a histogram
    without needing to calculate the histogram.

Deprecations
============

* Aliases of builtin `pickle` functions are deprecated, in favor of their
  unaliased ``pickle.<func>`` names:

  * `np.loads`
  * `np.core.numeric.load`
  * `np.core.numeric.loads`
  * `np.ma.loads`, `np.ma.dumps`
  * `np.ma.load`, `np.ma.dump` - these functions already failed on python 3,
    when called with a string.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================

``np.ma.notmasked_contiguous`` and ``np.ma.flatnotmasked_contiguous`` always return lists
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was always the documented behavior, but in reality the result used to be
any of slice, None, or list.

All downstream users seem to use detect the `None` result from
``flatnotmasked_contiguous`` and replace it with ``[]``.
These callers will continue to work as before.


C API changes
=============


New Features
============

``np.gcd`` and ``np.lcm`` ufuncs added for integer and objects types
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These compute the greatest common divisor, and lowest common multiple,
respectively. These work on all the numpy integer types, as well as the
builtin arbitrary-precision `Decimal` and `long` types.

Support for cross-platform builds for iOS
-----------------------------------------

The build system has been modified to add support for the
``_PYTHON_HOST_PLATFORM`` environment variable, used by ``distutils`` when
compiling on one platform for another platform. This makes it possible to
compile NumPy for iOS targets.

This only enables you to compile NumPy for one specific platform at a time.
Creating a full iOS-compatible NumPy package requires building for the 5
architectures supported by iOS (i386, x86_64, armv7, armv7s and arm64), and
combining these 5 compiled builds products into a single "fat" binary.

Support for ``dtype=object`` in ``isnan``, ``isinf``, ``isfinite``
------------------------------------------------------------------
Support added for any object types that define ``__float__``, ``__complex__``,
or ``__int__``/``__long__``. The return value for ``object`` inputs contains
Python ``bool``s and is of type ``object``.


Improvements
============

``histogram`` and ``histogramdd` functions have moved to ``np.lib.histograms``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These were originally found in ``np.lib.function_base``. They are still
available under their un-scoped ``np.histogram(dd)`` names, and
to maintain compatibility, aliased at ``np.lib.function_base.histogram(dd)``.

Code that does ``from np.lib.function_base import *`` will need to be updated
with the new location, and should consider not using ``import *`` in future.

``histogram`` will accept NaN values when explicit bins are given
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously it would fail when trying to compute a finite range for the data.
Since the range is ignored anyway when the bins are given explcitly, this error
was needless.

Note that calling `histogram` on NaN values continues to raise the
`RuntimeWarning`s typical of working with nan values, which can be silenced
as usual with `errstate`.

``histogram`` works on datetime types, when explicit bin edges are given
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dates, times, and timedeltas can now be histogrammed. The bin edges must be
passed explicitly, and are not yet computed automatically.

``np.r_`` works with 0d arrays, and ``np.ma.mr_` works with ``np.ma.masked``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0d arrays passed to the `r_` and `mr_` concatenation helpers are now treated as
though they are arrays of length 1. Previously, passing these was an error.
As a result, ``np.ma.mr_`` now works correctly on the ``masked`` constant.

``np.ptp`` accepts a ``keepdims`` argument, and extended axis tuples
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``np.ptp`` (peak-to-peak) can now work over multiple axes, just like `max` and
`min`.

``MaskedArray.astype`` now is identical to ``ndarray.astype``
-------------------------------------------------------------
This means it takes all the same arguments, making more code written for
ndarray work for masked array too.

Enable AVX2/AVX512 at compile time
-------------------------------------------------------------
Change to simd.inc.src to use AVX2 or AVX512 at compile time. Solving the gap
that if compile numpy for avx2 (or 512) with -march=native, still get the SSE
code for the simd functions even though rest of the code gets AVX2.

``nan_to_num`` always returns scalars when receiving scalar or 0d inputs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously an array was returned for integer scalar inputs, which is
inconsistent with the behavior for float inputs, and that of ufuncs in general.
For all types of scalar or 0d input, the result is now a scalar.

``np.flatnonzero`` works on numpy-convertible types
---------------------------------------------------
``np.flatnonzero`` now uses ``np.ravel(a)`` instead of ``a.ravel()``, so it
works for lists, tuples, etc.

``np.interp`` returns numpy scalars rather than builtin scalars
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``np.interp(0.5, [0, 1], [10, 20])`` would return a ``float``, but
now it returns a ``np.float64`` object, which more closely matches the behavior
of other functions.

Additionally, the special case of ``np.interp(object_array_0d, ...)`` is no
longer supported, as ``np.interp(object_array_nd)`` was never supported anyway.

As a result of this change, the ``period`` argument can now be used on 0d
arrays.

Allow dtype field names to be unicode in Python 2
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``np.dtype([(u'name', float)])`` would raise a ``TypeError`` in
Python 2, as only bytestrings were allowed in field names. Now any unicode
string field names will be encoded with the ``ascii`` codec, raising a
``UnicodeEncodeError`` upon failure.

This change makes it easier to write Python 2/3 compatible code using
``from __future__ import unicode_literals``, which previously would cause
string literal field names to raise a TypeError in Python 2.
