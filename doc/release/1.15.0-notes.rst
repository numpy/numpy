==========================
NumPy 1.15.0 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights
==========


New functions
=============

* `np.gcd` and `np.lcm`, to compute the greatest common divisor and least
  common multiple.
* `np.ma.stack`, the `np.stack` array-joining function generalized to masked
  arrays.

* `np.printoptions`, the context manager which sets print options temporarily
  for the scope of the ``with`` block::

    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=2):
    ...     print(np.array([2.0])) / 3
    [0.67] 


Deprecations
============

* Aliases of builtin `pickle` functions are deprecated, in favor of their
  unaliased ``pickle.<func>`` names:

  * `np.loads`
  * `np.core.numeric.load`
  * `np.core.numeric.loads`
  * `np.ma.loads`, `np.ma.dumps`
  * `np.ma.load`, `np.ma.dump` - these functions already failed on python 3,
    when called with a string.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================


C API changes
=============


New Features
============

``np.gcd`` and ``np.lcm`` ufuncs added for integer and objects types
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These compute the greatest common divisor, and lowest common multiple,
respectively. These work on all the numpy integer types, as well as the
builtin arbitrary-precision `Decimal` and `long` types.


Improvements
============

``histogram`` and ``histogramdd` functions have moved to ``np.lib.histograms``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These were originally found in ``np.lib.function_base``. They are still
available under their un-scoped ``np.histogram(dd)`` names, and
to maintain compatibility, aliased at ``np.lib.function_base.histogram(dd)``.

Code that does ``from np.lib.function_base import *`` will need to be updated
with the new location, and should consider not using ``import *`` in future.

``histogram`` will accept NaN values when explicit bins are given
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously it would fail when trying to compute a finite range for the data.
Since the range is ignored anyway when the bins are given explcitly, this error
was needless.

Note that calling `histogram` on NaN values continues to raise the
`RuntimeWarning`s typical of working with nan values, which can be silenced
as usual with `errstate`.

``histogram`` works on datetime types, when explicit bin edges are given
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dates, times, and timedeltas can now be histogrammed. The bin edges must be
passed explicitly, and are not yet computed automatically.

``np.r_`` works with 0d arrays, and ``np.ma.mr_` works with ``np.ma.masked``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0d arrays passed to the `r_` and `mr_` concatenation helpers are now treated as
though they are arrays of length 1. Previously, passing these was an error.
As a result, ``np.ma.mr_`` now works correctly on the ``masked`` constant.

``np.ptp`` accepts a ``keepdims`` argument, and extended axis tuples
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``np.ptp`` (peak-to-peak) can now work over multiple axes, just like `max` and
`min`.

``MaskedArray.astype`` now is identical to ``ndarray.astype``
-------------------------------------------------------------
This means it takes all the same arguments, making more code written for
ndarray work for masked array too.

Enable AVX2/AVX512 at compile time
-------------------------------------------------------------
Change to simd.inc.src to use AVX2 or AVX512 at compile time. Solving the gap
that if compile numpy for avx2 (or 512) with -march=native, still get the SSE
code for the simd functions even though rest of the code gets AVX2.

``nan_to_num`` always returns scalars when receiving scalar or 0d inputs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously an array was returned for integer scalar inputs, which is
inconsistent with the behavior for float inputs, and that of ufuncs in general.
For all types of scalar or 0d input, the result is now a scalar.

``np.flatnonzero`` works on numpy-convertible types
---------------------------------------------------
``np.flatnonzero`` now uses ``np.ravel(a)`` instead of ``a.ravel()``, so it
works for lists, tuples, etc.

``np.interp`` returns numpy scalars rather than builtin scalars
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``np.interp(0.5, [0, 1], [10, 20])`` would return a ``float``, but
now it returns a ``np.float64`` object, which more closely matches the behavior
of other functions.

Additionally, the special case of ``np.interp(object_array_0d, ...)`` is no
longer supported, as ``np.interp(object_array_nd)`` was never supported anyway.

As a result of this change, the ``period`` argument can now be used on 0d
arrays.
