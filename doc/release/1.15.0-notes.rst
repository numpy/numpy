==========================
NumPy 1.15.0 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights
==========

* NumPy has switched to pytest for testing.


New functions
=============

* `np.gcd` and `np.lcm`, to compute the greatest common divisor and least
  common multiple.
* `np.ma.stack`, the `np.stack` array-joining function generalized to masked
  arrays.
* ``quantile`` function, an interface to ``percentile`` without factors of 100
* ``nanquantile`` function, an interface to ``nanpercentile`` without factors
  of 100

* `np.printoptions`, the context manager which sets print options temporarily
  for the scope of the ``with`` block::

    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=2):
    ...     print(np.array([2.0]) / 3)
    [0.67]

  * `np.histogram_bin_edges`, a function to get the edges of the bins used by a histogram
    without needing to calculate the histogram.

Deprecations
============

* Aliases of builtin `pickle` functions are deprecated, in favor of their
  unaliased ``pickle.<func>`` names:

  * `np.loads`
  * `np.core.numeric.load`
  * `np.core.numeric.loads`
  * `np.ma.loads`, `np.ma.dumps`
  * `np.ma.load`, `np.ma.dump` - these functions already failed on python 3,
    when called with a string.
* Direct imports from the following modules is deprecated. All testing related
  imports should come from `numpy.testing`.
  * `np.testing.utils`
  * `np.testing.decorators`
  * `np.testing.nosetester`
  * `np.testing.noseclasses`
  * `np.core.umath_tests`

* Giving a generator to `np.sum` is now deprecated. This was undocumented, but
  worked. Previously, it would calculate the sum of the generator expression.
  In the future, it might return a different result. Use `np.sum(np.from_iter(generator))`
  or the built-in Python `sum` instead.

* Users of the C-API should call ``PyArrayResolveWriteBackIfCopy`` or 
  ``PyArray_DiscardWritbackIfCopy`` on any array with the ``WRITEBACKIFCOPY``
  flag set, before the array is deallocated. A deprecation warning will be
  emitted if those calls are not used when needed.

* Users of ``nditer`` should use the nditer object as a context manager
  anytime one of the iterator operands is writeable, so that numpy can
  manage writeback semantics, or should call ``it.close()``. A
 `RuntimeWarning` will be emitted otherwise in these cases. Users of the C-API
  should call ``NpyIter_Close`` before ``NpyIter_Deallocate``.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================

Under certain conditions, nditer must be used in a context manager
------------------------------------------------------------------
When using an nditer with the ``"writeonly"`` or ``"readwrite"`` flags, there
are some circumstances where nditer doesn't actually give you a view onto the
writable array. Instead, it gives you a copy, and if you make changes to the
copy, nditer later writes those changes back into your actual array. Currently,
this writeback occurs when the array objects are garbage collected, which makes
this API error-prone on CPython and entirely broken on PyPy. Therefore, 
``nditer`` should now be used as a context manager whenever using ``nditer``
with writeable arrays (``with np.nditer(...) as it: ...``). You may also
explicitly call ``it.close()`` for cases where a context manager is unusable,
for instance in generator expressions.

Numpy has switched to using pytest instead of nose for testing
--------------------------------------------------------------
The last nose release was 1.3.7 in June, 2015, and development of that tool has
ended, consequently NumPy has now switched to using pytest. The old decorators
and nose tools that were previously used by some downstream projects remain
available, but will not be maintained. The standard testing utilities,
`assert_almost_equal` and such, are not be affected by this change except for
the nose specific functions `import_nose` and `raises`. Those functions are
not used in numpy, but are kept for downstream compatibility.

``np.ma.notmasked_contiguous`` and ``np.ma.flatnotmasked_contiguous`` always return lists
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was always the documented behavior, but in reality the result used to be
any of slice, None, or list.

All downstream users seem to use detect the `None` result from
``flatnotmasked_contiguous`` and replace it with ``[]``.
These callers will continue to work as before.

``np.squeeze`` now respects the API expectation of objects that do not handle an ``axis`` argument
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prior to version ``1.7.0`` ``np.squeeze`` did not have an ``axis`` argument and all empty axes were removed
by default. After incorporation of an ``axis`` argument, it was possible to selectively squeeze single
or multiple empty axes, but the old API expectation was not respected because the axes could still be
selectively removed (silent success) in an object depending on the old API. The silent success is no
longer possible, and objects expecting the old API are respected. The silent success was prevented
by removing the interception of an otherwise-normal Exception when ``axis`` was provided to an object
using the old API.


C API changes
=============

* ``NpyIter_Close`` has been added and should be called before
  ``NpyIter_Deallocate`` to resolve possible writeback-enabled arrays.

New Features
============

``np.gcd`` and ``np.lcm`` ufuncs added for integer and objects types
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These compute the greatest common divisor, and lowest common multiple,
respectively. These work on all the numpy integer types, as well as the
builtin arbitrary-precision `Decimal` and `long` types.

Support for cross-platform builds for iOS
-----------------------------------------
The build system has been modified to add support for the
``_PYTHON_HOST_PLATFORM`` environment variable, used by ``distutils`` when
compiling on one platform for another platform. This makes it possible to
compile NumPy for iOS targets.

This only enables you to compile NumPy for one specific platform at a time.
Creating a full iOS-compatible NumPy package requires building for the 5
architectures supported by iOS (i386, x86_64, armv7, armv7s and arm64), and
combining these 5 compiled builds products into a single "fat" binary.

``np.quantile`` and ``np.nanquantile``
--------------------------------------
Like ``np.percentile`` and ``np.nanpercentile``, but takes quantiles in [0, 1]
rather than percentiles in [0, 100]. ``np.percentile`` is now a thin wrapper
around ``np.quantile`` with the extra step of dividing by 100.


Build system
------------
Added experimental support for the 64-bit RISC-V architecture.

Improvements
============

``np.ufunc.reduce`` and related functions now accept an initial value
---------------------------------------------------------------------
``np.ufunc.reduce``, ``np.sum``, ``np.prod``, ``np.min`` and ``np.max`` all
now accept an ``initial`` keyword argument that specifies the value to start
the reduction with.

``np.flip`` can operate over multiple axes
------------------------------------------
``np.flip`` now accepts None, or tuples of int, in its ``axis`` argument. If
axis is None, it will flip over all the axes.

``histogram`` and ``histogramdd`` functions have moved to ``np.lib.histograms``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These were originally found in ``np.lib.function_base``. They are still
available under their un-scoped ``np.histogram(dd)`` names, and
to maintain compatibility, aliased at ``np.lib.function_base.histogram(dd)``.

Code that does ``from np.lib.function_base import *`` will need to be updated
with the new location, and should consider not using ``import *`` in future.

``histogram`` will accept NaN values when explicit bins are given
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously it would fail when trying to compute a finite range for the data.
Since the range is ignored anyway when the bins are given explicitly, this error
was needless.

Note that calling `histogram` on NaN values continues to raise the
`RuntimeWarning`s typical of working with nan values, which can be silenced
as usual with `errstate`.

``histogram`` works on datetime types, when explicit bin edges are given
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dates, times, and timedeltas can now be histogrammed. The bin edges must be
passed explicitly, and are not yet computed automatically.

``histogram`` "auto" estimator handles limited variance better
------------------------------------------------------------------------
No longer does an IQR of 0 result in `n_bins=1`, rather the number of bins
chosen is related to the data size in this situation.

``histogramdd`` allows explicit ranges to be given in a subset of axes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The ``range`` argument of `histogramdd` can now contain ``None`` values to
indicate that the range for the corresponding axis should be computed from the
data. Previously, this could not be specified on a per-axis basis.

``np.r_`` works with 0d arrays, and ``np.ma.mr_`` works with ``np.ma.masked``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0d arrays passed to the `r_` and `mr_` concatenation helpers are now treated as
though they are arrays of length 1. Previously, passing these was an error.
As a result, ``np.ma.mr_`` now works correctly on the ``masked`` constant.

``np.ptp`` accepts a ``keepdims`` argument, and extended axis tuples
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``np.ptp`` (peak-to-peak) can now work over multiple axes, just like `max` and
`min`.

``MaskedArray.astype`` now is identical to ``ndarray.astype``
-------------------------------------------------------------
This means it takes all the same arguments, making more code written for
ndarray work for masked array too.

Enable AVX2/AVX512 at compile time
-------------------------------------------------------------
Change to simd.inc.src to use AVX2 or AVX512 at compile time. Solving the gap
that if compile numpy for avx2 (or 512) with -march=native, still get the SSE
code for the simd functions even though rest of the code gets AVX2.

``nan_to_num`` always returns scalars when receiving scalar or 0d inputs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously an array was returned for integer scalar inputs, which is
inconsistent with the behavior for float inputs, and that of ufuncs in general.
For all types of scalar or 0d input, the result is now a scalar.

``np.flatnonzero`` works on numpy-convertible types
---------------------------------------------------
``np.flatnonzero`` now uses ``np.ravel(a)`` instead of ``a.ravel()``, so it
works for lists, tuples, etc.

``np.interp`` returns numpy scalars rather than builtin scalars
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``np.interp(0.5, [0, 1], [10, 20])`` would return a ``float``, but
now it returns a ``np.float64`` object, which more closely matches the behavior
of other functions.

Additionally, the special case of ``np.interp(object_array_0d, ...)`` is no
longer supported, as ``np.interp(object_array_nd)`` was never supported anyway.

As a result of this change, the ``period`` argument can now be used on 0d
arrays.

Allow dtype field names to be unicode in Python 2
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``np.dtype([(u'name', float)])`` would raise a ``TypeError`` in
Python 2, as only bytestrings were allowed in field names. Now any unicode
string field names will be encoded with the ``ascii`` codec, raising a
``UnicodeEncodeError`` upon failure.

This change makes it easier to write Python 2/3 compatible code using
``from __future__ import unicode_literals``, which previously would cause
string literal field names to raise a TypeError in Python 2.

Comparison ufuncs accept ``dtype=object``, overriding the default ``bool``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This allows object arrays of symbolic types, which override ``==`` and other
operators to return expressions, to be compared elementwise with
``np.equal(a, b, dtype=object)``.

``sort`` functions accept ``kind='stable'``
-------------------------------------------
Up until now, to perform a stable sort on the data, the user must do:

    >>> np.sort([5, 2, 6, 2, 1], kind='mergesort')
    [1, 2, 2, 5, 6]

because merge sort is the only stable sorting algorithm available in
NumPy. However, having kind='mergesort' does not make it explicit that
the user wants to perform a stable sort thus harming the readability.

This change allows the user to specify kind='stable' thus clarifying
the intent.

Do not make temporary copies for in-place accumulation
------------------------------------------------------
When ufuncs perform accumulation they no longer make temporary copies because
of the overlap between input an output, that is, the next element accumulated
is added before the accumulated result is stored in its place, hence the
overlap is safe. Avoiding the copy results in faster execution.
