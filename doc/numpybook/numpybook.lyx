\begin_layout Standard
NumPy builds on (and is a successor to) the successful Numeric array object.
 Its goal is to create the corner-stone for a useful environment for scientific
 computing.
 In order to better understand the people surrounding NumPy and (its library-pac
kage) SciPy, I will explain a little about how SciPy and (current) NumPy
 originated.
 In 1998, as a graduate student studying biomedical imaging at the Mayo
 Clinic in Rochester, MN, I came across Python and its numerical extension
 (Numeric) while I was looking for ways to analyze large data sets for Magnetic
 Resonance Imaging and Ultrasound using a high-level language.
 I quickly fell in love with Python programming which is a remarkable statement
 to make about a programming language.
 If I had not seen others with the same view, I might have seriously doubted
 my sanity.
 I became rather involved in the Numeric Python community, adding the C-API
 chapter to the Numeric documentation (for which Paul Dubois graciously
 made me a co-author).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I progressed with my thesis work, programming in Python was so enjoyable
 that I felt inhibited when I worked with other programming frameworks.
 As a result, when a task I needed to perform was not available in the core
 language, or in the Numeric extension, I looked around and found C or Fortran
 code that performed the needed task, wrapped it into Python (either by
 hand or using SWIG), and used the new functionality in my programs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along the way, I learned a great deal about the underlying structure of
 Numeric and grew to admire it's simple but elegant structures that grew
 out of the mechanism by which Python allows itself to be extended.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
Numeric was originally written in 1995 based off of an earlier Matrix Object
 design by Jim Fulton which was released in 1994.
 Most of the code was written by Jim Hugunin while he was a graduate student
 at MIT.
 He received help from many people including Jim Fulton, David Ascher, Paul
 Dubois, and Konrad Hinsen.
 These individuals and many others added comments, criticisms, and code
 which helped the Numeric extension reach stability.
 Jim Hugunin did not stay long as an active member of the community ---
 moving on to write Jython and, later, Iron Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By operating in this need-it-make-it fashion I ended up with a substantial
 library of extension modules that helped Python + Numeric become easier
 to use in a scientific setting.
 These early modules included raw input-output functions, a special function
 library, an integration library, an ordinary differential equation solver,
 some least-squares optimizers, and sparse matrix solvers.
 While I was doing this laborious work, Pearu Peterson noticed that a lot
 of the routines I was wrapping were written in Fortran, and there was no
 simplified wrapping mechanism for Fortran subroutines (like SWIG for C).
 He began the task of writing f2py which made it possible to easily wrap
 Fortran programs into Python.
 I helped him a little bit, mostly with testing and contributing early function-
call-back code, but he put forth the brunt of the work.
 His result was simply amazing to me.
 I've always been impressed with f2py, especially because I knew how much
 effort writing and maintaining extension modules could be.
 Anybody serious about scientific computing with Python will appreciate
 that f2py is distributed along with NumPy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I finished my Ph.D.
 in 2001, Eric Jones (who had recently completed his Ph.D.
 at Duke) contacted me because he had a collection of Python modules he
 had developed as part of his thesis work as well.
 He wanted to combine his modules with mine into one super package.
 Together with Pearu Peterson we joined our efforts, and SciPy was born
 in 2001.
 Since then, many people have contributed module code to SciPy including
 Ed Schofield, Robert Cimrman, David M.
 Cooke, Charles (Chuck) Harris, Prabhu Ramachandran, Gary Strangman, Jean-Sebast
ien Roy, and Fernando Perez.
 Others such as Travis Vaught, David Morrill, Jeff Whitaker, and Louis Luangkeso
rn have contributed testing and build support.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of 2005, SciPy was at release 0.3 and relatively stable for
 an early version number.
 Part of the reason it was difficult to stabilize SciPy was that the array
 object upon which SciPy builds was undergoing a bit of an upheaval.
 At about the same time as SciPy was being built, some Numeric users were
 hitting up against the limited capabilities of Numeric.
 In particular, the ability to deal with memory mapped files (and associated
 alignment and swapping issues), record arrays, and altered error checking
 modes were important but limited or non-existent in Numeric.
 As a result, numarray was created by Perry Greenfield, Todd Miller, and
 Rick White at the Space Science Telescope Institute as a replacement for
 Numeric.
 Numarray used a very different implementation scheme as a mix of Python
 classes and C code (which led to slow downs in certain common uses).
 While improving some capabilities, it was slow to pick up on the more advanced
 features of Numeric's universal functions (ufuncs) --- never re-creating
 the C-API that SciPy depended on.
 This made it difficult for SciPy to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

convert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to numarray.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many newcomers to scientific computing with Python were told that numarray
 was the future and started developing for it.
 Very useful tools were developed that could not be used with Numeric (because
 of numarray's change in C-API), and therefore could not be used easily
 in SciPy.
 This state of affairs was very discouraging for me personally as it left
 the community fragmented.
 Some developed for numarray, others developed as part of SciPy.
 A few people even rejected adopting Python for scientific computing entirely
 because of the split.
 In addition, I estimate that quite a few Python users simply stayed away
 from both SciPy and numarray, leaving the community smaller than it could
 have been given the number of people that use Python for science and engineerin
g purposes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be recognized that the split was not intentional, but simply an
 outgrowth of the different and exacting demands of scientific computing
 users.
 My describing these events should not be construed as assigning blame to
 anyone.
 I very much admire and appreciate everyone I've met who is involved with
 scientific computing and Python.
 Using a stretched biological metaphor, it is only through the process of
 dividing and merging that better results are born.
 I think this concept applies to NumPy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In early 2005, I decided to begin an effort to help bring the diverging
 community together under a common framework if it were possible.
 I first looked at numarray to see what could be done to add the missing
 features to make SciPy work with it as a core array object.
 After a couple of days of studying numarray, I was not enthusiastic about
 this approach.
 My familiarity with the Numeric code base no doubt biased my opinion, but
 it seemed to me that the features of Numarray could be added back to Numeric
 with a few fundamental changes to the core object.
 This would make the transition of SciPy to a more enhanced array object
 much easier in my mind.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, I began to construct this hybrid array object complete with an
 enhanced set of universal (broadcasting) functions that could deal with
 it.
 Along the way, quite a few new features and significant enhancements were
 added to the array object and its surrounding infrastructure.
 This book describes the result of that year-and-a-half-long effort which
 culminated with the release of NumPy 0.9.2 in early 2006 and NumPy 1.0 in
 late 2006.
 I first named the new package, SciPy Core, and used the scipy namespace.
 However, after a few months of testing under that name, it became clear
 that a separate namespace was needed for the new package.
 As a result, a rapid search for a new name resulted in actually coming
 back to the NumPy name which was the unofficial name of Numerical Python
 but never the actual namespace.
 Because the new package builds on the code-base of and is a successor to
 Numeric, I think the NumPy name is fitting and hopefully not too confusing
 to new users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book only briefly outlines some of the infrastructure that surrounds
 the basic objects in NumPy to provide the additional functionality contained
 in the older Numeric package (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 LinearAlgebra, RandomArray, FFT).
 This infrastructure in NumPy includes basic linear algebra routines, Fourier
 transform capabilities, and random number generators.
 In addition, the f2py module is described in its own documentation, and
 so is only briefly mentioned in the second part of the book.
 There are also extensions to the standard Python distutils and testing
 frameworks included with NumPy that are useful in constructing your own
 packages built on top of NumPy.
 The central purpose of this book, however, is to describe and document
 the basic NumPy system that is available under the numpy namespace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
The numpy namespace includes all names under the numpy.core and numpy.lib
 namespaces as well.
 Thus, 
\family typewriter
import numpy
\family default
 will also import the names from numpy.core and numpy.lib.
 This is the recommended way to use numpy.

NumPy provides two fundamental objects: an N-dimensional array object (
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
) and a universal function object (
\family typewriter
ufunc
\family default
).
 In addition, there are other objects that build on top of these which you
 may find useful in your work, and these will be discussed later.
 The current chapter will provide background information on just the 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
ufunc
\family default
 that will be important for understanding the attributes and methods to
 be discussed later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An N-dimensional array is a homogeneous collection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

items
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 indexed using 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 integers.
 There are two essential pieces of information that define an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array: 1) the shape of the array, and 2) the kind of item the
 array is composed of.
 The shape of the array is a tuple of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 integers (one for each dimension) that provides information on how far
 the index can vary along that dimension.
 The other important information describing an array is the kind of item
 the array is composed of.
 Because every 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 is a homogeneous collection of exactly the same data-type, every item takes
 up the same size block of memory, and each block of memory in the array
 is interpreted in exactly the same way

By using OBJECT arrays, one can effectively have heterogeneous arrays, but
 the system still sees each element of the array as exactly the same thing
 (a reference to a Python object).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Tip
All arrays in NumPy are indexed starting at 0 and ending at M-1 following
 the Python convention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, consider the following piece of code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
\newline
>>> a.shape
\newline
(2, 3)
\newline
>>> a.dtype

\begin_layout Note
for all code in this book it is assumed that you have first entered 
\family typewriter

.
 In addition, any previously defined arrays are still defined for subsequent
 examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This code defines an array of size 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times3$
\end_inset

 composed of 4-byte (little-endian) integer elements (on my 32-bit platform).
 We can index into this two-dimensional array using two integers: the first
 integer running from 0 to 1 inclusive and the second from 0 to 2 inclusive.
 For example, index 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,1\right)$
\end_inset

 selects the element with value 5:

\begin_layout Section
Data-Type Descriptors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In NumPy, an ndarray is an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array of items where each item takes up a fixed number of bytes.
 Typically, this fixed number of bytes represents a number (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 integer or floating-point).
 However, this fixed number of bytes could also represent an arbitrary record
 made up of any collection of other data types.
 NumPy achieves this flexibility through the use of a data-type (dtype)
 object.
 Every array has an associated dtype object which describes the layout of
 the array data.
 Every dtype
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "dtype"

\end_inset

 object, in turn, has an associated Python type-object that determines exactly
 what type of Python object is returned when an element of the array is
 accessed.
 The dtype objects are flexible enough to contain references to arrays of
 other dtype objects and, therefore, can be used to define nested records.
 This advanced functionality will be described in better detail later as
 it is mainly useful for the recarray (record array) subclass that will
 also be defined later.
 However, all ndarrays can enjoy the flexibility provided by the dtype objects.
 Figure

 provides a conceptual diagram showing the relationship between the ndarray,
 its associated data-type object, and an array-scalar that is returned when
 a single-element of the array is accessed.
 Note that the data-type points to the type-object of the array scalar

\begin_layout Standard
Every dtype object is based on one of 21 built-in dtype objects.
 These built-in objects allow numeric operations on a wide-variety of integer,
 floating-point, and complex data types.
 Associated with each data-type is a Python type object whose instances
 are array scalars.
 This type-object can be obtained using the 
\family typewriter
type
\family default
 attribute of the dtype object.
 Python typically defines only one data-type of a particular data class
 (one integer type, one floating-point type, etc.).
 This can be convenient for some applications that don't need to be concerned
 with all the ways data can be represented in a computer.
 For scientific applications, however, this is not always true.
 As a result, in NumPy, their are 21 different fundamental Python data-type-desc
riptor objects built-in.
 These descriptors are mostly based on the types available in the C language
 that CPython is written in.
 However, there are a few types that are extremely flexible, such as 
\family typewriter

\family default

\family typewriter

e.g.

\emph default
 int8, float64, complex128).
 The C-like names are also accessible using a character code which is also
 shown in the table (use of the character codes, however, is discouraged).
 Names for the data types that would clash with standard Python object names
 are followed by a trailing underscore, '_'.
 These data types are so named because they use the same underlying precision
 as the corresponding Python data types.
 Most scientific users should be able to use the array-enhanced scalar objects
 in place of the Python objects.
 The array-enhanced scalars inherit from the Python objects they can replace
 and should act like them under all circumstances (except for how errors
 are handled in math computations).

float
\series default

object
\series default
_, 
\series bold
unicode
\series default
_, and 
\series bold
str_
\series default
 are enhanced-scalars.
 They are very similar to the standard Python types (without the trailing
 underscore) and inherit from them (except for bool_ and object_).
 They can be used in place of the standard Python types whenever desired.
 Whenever a data type is required, as an argument, the standard Python types
 are recognized as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three of the data types are flexible in that they can have items that are
 of an arbitrary size: the 
\family typewriter
str_
\family default
 type, the 
\family typewriter
unicode_
\family default
 type, and the 
\family typewriter
void
\family default
 type.
 While, you can specify an arbitrary size for these types, every item in
 an array is still of that specified size.
 The void type, for example, allows for arbitrary records to be defined
 as elements of the array, and can be used to define exotic types built
 on top of the basic 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
.

Built-in array-scalar types corresponding to data-types for an ndarray.
 The bold-face types correspond to standard Python types.
 The object_ type is special because arrays with dtype='O' do not return
 an array scalar on item access but instead return the actual object referenced
 in the array.

The two types

 are not separate types.
 They are names bound to a specific integer type just large enough to hold
 a memory address (a pointer) on the platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
Numeric Compatibility: If you used old typecode characters in your Numeric
 code (which was never recommended), you will need to change some of them
 to the new characters.
 In particular, the needed changes are 'c->'S1', 'b'->'B', '1'->'b', 's'->'h',
 'w'->'H', and 'u'->'I'.
 These changes make the typecharacter convention more consistent with other
 Python modules such as the struct module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental data-types are arranged into a hierarchy of Python type-objects
 shown in Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Hierarchy-of-type"

\end_inset

.
 Each of the leaves on this hierarchy correspond to actual data-types that
 arrays can have (in other words, there is a built in dtype object associated
 with each of these new types).
 They also correspond to new Python objects that can be created.
 These new objects are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scalar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 types corresponding to each fundamental data-type.
 Their purpose is to smooth out the rough edges that result when mixing
 scalar and array operations.
 These scalar objects will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Scalar-objects"

\end_inset

.
 The other types in the hierarchy define particular categories of types.
 These categories can be useful for testing whether or not the object returned

 is of a particular class (using

\begin_layout Section
Basic indexing (slicing)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indexing
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "indexing"

\end_inset

 is a powerful tool in Python and NumPy takes full advantage of this power.
 In fact, some of capabilities of Python's indexing were first established
 by the needs of Numeric users.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the ability to index with a comma separated list of objects
 and have it correspond to indexing with a tuple is a feature added to Python
 at the request of the NumPy community.
 The Ellipsis object was also added to Python explicitly for the NumPy community.
 Extended slicing (wherein a step can be provided) was also a feature added
 to Python because of Numeric.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Indexing is also sometimes called slicing in Python, and slicing for an
 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 works very similarly as it does for other Python sequences.
 There are three big differences: 1) slicing can be done over multiple dimension
s, 2) exactly one ellipsis object can be used to indicate several dimensions
 at once, 3) slicing cannot be used to expand the size of an array (unlike
 lists).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few examples should make slicing more clear.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times20$
\end_inset

 array, then 
\begin_inset Formula $A[3]$
\end_inset

 is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $A[3,:]$
\end_inset

 and represents the 4th length-20 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

row
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the array.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $A[:,3]$
\end_inset

 represents the 4th length-10 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

column
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the array.
 Every third element of the 4th column can be selected as 
\begin_inset Formula $A[::3,3]$
\end_inset

.
 Ellipses can be used to replace zero or more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 terms.
 In other words, an Ellipsis
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "Ellipsis"

\end_inset

 object expands to zero or more full slice objects (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) so that the total number of dimensions in the slicing tuple matches the
 number of dimensions in the array.
 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times20\times30\times40$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $A[3:,...,4]$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $A[3:,:,:,4]$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $A[...,3]$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $A[:,:,:,3].$
\end_inset

Memory Layout of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a fundamental level, an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array object is just a one-dimensional sequence of memory with
 fancy indexing code that maps an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional index into a one-dimensional index.
 The one-dimensional index is necessary on some level because that is how
 memory is addressed in a computer.
 The fancy indexing, however, can be very helpful for translating our ideas
 into computer code.
 This is because many concepts we wish to model on a computer have a natural
 representation as an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array.
 While this is especially true in science and engineering, it is also applicable
 to many other arenas which can be appreciated by considering the popularity
 of the spreadsheet as well as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

image processing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
Some high-level languages give pre-eminence to a particular use of 2-dimensional
 arrays as Matrices.
 In NumPy, however, the core object is the more general 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array.
 NumPy defines a matrix object as a sub-class of the N-dimensional array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to more fully understand the array object along with its attributes
 and methods it is important to learn more about how an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array is represented in the computer's memory.
 A complete understanding of this layout is only essential for optimizing
 algorithms operating on general purpose arrays.
 But, even for the casual user, a general understanding of memory layout
 will help to explain the use of certain array attributes that may otherwise
 be mysterious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contiguous Memory Layout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a fundamental ambiguity in how the mapping to a one-dimensional
 index can take place which is illustrated for a 2-dimensional array in
 Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Options-for-memory"

\end_inset

.
 In that figure, each block represents a chunk of memory that is needed
 for representing the underlying array element.
 For example, each block could represent the 8 bytes needed to represent
 a double-precision floating point number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the figure, two arrays are shown, a 
\begin_inset Formula $4x3$
\end_inset

 array and a 
\begin_inset Formula $3x4$
\end_inset

 array.
 Each of these arrays takes 12 blocks of memory shown as a single, contiguous
 segment.
 How this memory is used to form the abstract 2-dimensional array can vary,
 however, and the 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object supports both styles.
 Which style is in use can be interrogated by the use of the flags attribute
 which returns a dictionary of the state of array flags.

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

 the last 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional index 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

varies the fastest.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In other words, to move through computer memory sequentially, the last
 index is incremented first, followed by the second-to-last index and so
 forth.
 Some of the algorithms in NumPy that deal with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional arrays work best with this kind of data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Fortran-style of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional indexing shown on the right of Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Options-for-memory"

\end_inset

, the first 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional index 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

varies the fastest.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thus, to move through computer memory sequentially, the first index is
 incremented first until it reaches the limit in that dimension, then the
 second index is incremented and the first index is reset to zero.
 While NumPy can be compiled without the use of a Fortran compiler, several
 modules of SciPy (available separately) rely on underlying algorithms written
 in Fortran.
 Algorithms that work on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional arrays that are written in Fortran typically expect Fortran-style
 arrays.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two-styles of memory layout for arrays are connected through the transpose
 operation.
 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a (contiguous) C-style array, then the same block of memory can be used
 to represent 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

 as a (contiguous) Fortran-style array.
 This kind of understanding can be useful when trying to optimize the wrapping
 of Fortran subroutines, or if a more detailed understanding of how to write
 algorithms for generally-indexed arrays is desired.
 But, fortunately, the casual user who does not care if an array is copied
 occasionally to get it into the right orientation needed for a particular
 algorithm can forget about how the array is stored in memory and just visualize
 it as an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array (that is, after all, the whole point of creating the
 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object in the first place).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Non-contiguous memory layout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of the examples presented above are 
\emph on
single-segment
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "single-segment"

\end_inset


\emph default
 arrays where the entire array is visited by sequentially marching through
 memory one element at a time.
 When an algorithm in C or Fortran expects an N-dimensional array, this
 single segment (of a certain fundamental type) is usually what is expected
 along with the shape 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-tuple.
 With a single-segment of memory representing the array, the one-dimensional
 index into computer memory can always be computed from the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional index.
 This concept is explored further in the following paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 index into an array whose shape is represented by the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 integers 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=0\ldots N-1).$
\end_inset

 Then, the one-dimensional index into a C-style contiguous array is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
n^{C}=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}n_{i}\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}d_{j}\]

\end_inset

 while the one-dimensional index into a Fortran-style contiguous array is
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
n^{F}=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}n_{i}\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}d_{j}.\]

\end_inset

 In these formulas we are assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\prod_{j=k}^{m}d_{j}=d_{k}d_{k+1}\cdots d_{m-1}d_{m}\]

\end_inset

so that if 
\begin_inset Formula $m<k,$
\end_inset

 the product is 
\begin_inset Formula $1.$
\end_inset

 While perfectly general, these formulas may be a bit confusing at first
 glimpse.
 Let's see how they expand out for determining the one-dimensional index
 corresponding to the element 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,3,2\right)$
\end_inset

 of a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times5\times6$
\end_inset

 array.
 If the array is stored as Fortran contiguous, then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
n^{F} & = & n_{0}\cdot\left(1\right)+n_{1}\cdot(4)+n_{2}\cdot\left(4\cdot5\right)\\
 & = & 1+3\cdot4+2\cdot20=53.\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 On the other hand, if the array is stored as C contiguous, then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
n^{C} & = & n_{0}\cdot\left(5\cdot6\right)+n_{1}\cdot\left(6\right)+n_{2}\cdot\left(1\right)\\
 & = & 1\cdot30+3\cdot6+2\cdot1=50.\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The general pattern should be more clear from these examples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formulas for the one-dimensional index of the N-dimensional arrays reveal
 what results in an important generalization for memory layout.
 Notice that each formula can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
n^{X}=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}n_{i}s_{i}^{X}\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}^{X}$
\end_inset

 gives the 
\emph on
stride
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "stride"

\end_inset


\emph default
 for dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
Our definition of stride here is an element-based stride, while the strides
 attribute returns a byte-based stride.
 The byte-based stride is the element itemsize multiplied by the element-based
 stride.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Thus, for C and Fortran contiguous arrays respectively we have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
s_{i}^{C} & = & \prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}d_{j}=d_{i+1}d_{i+2}\cdots d_{N-1},\\
s_{i}^{F} & = & \prod_{j=0}^{i-1}d_{j}=d_{0}d_{1}\cdots d_{i-1}.\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stride is how many elements in the underlying one-dimensional layout
 of the array one must jump in order to get to the next array element of
 a specific dimension in the N-dimensional layout.
 Thus, in a C-style 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times5\times6$
\end_inset

 array one must jump over 30 elements to increment the first index by one,
 so 30 is the stride for the first dimension (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}^{C}=30$
\end_inset

).
 If, for each array, we define a strides tuple with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 integers, then we have pre-computed and stored an important piece of how
 to map the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional index to the one-dimensional one used by the computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to providing a pre-computed table for index mapping, by allowing
 the strides tuple to consist of arbitrary integers we have provided a more
 general layout for the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array.
 As long as we always use the stride information to move around in the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional array, we can use any convenient layout we wish for the underlying
 representation as long as it is regular enough to be defined by constant
 jumps in each dimension.
 The 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object of NumPy uses this stride information and therefore the underlying
 memory of an 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 can be laid out dis-contiguously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
Several algorithms in NumPy work on arbitrarily strided arrays.
 However, some algorithms require single-segment arrays.
 When an irregularly strided array is passed in to such algorithms, a copy
 is automatically made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important situation where irregularly strided arrays occur is array indexing.
 Consider again Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Options-for-memory"

\end_inset

.
 In that figure a high-lighted sub-array is shown.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times3$
\end_inset

 C contiguous array and 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times4$
\end_inset

 Fortran contiguous array.
 The highlighted areas can be written respectively as 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

[1:3,1:3] and 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

[1:3,1:3].
 As evidenced by the corresponding highlighted region in the one-dimensional
 view of the memory, these sub-arrays are neither C contiguous nor Fortran
 contiguous.
 However, they can still be represented by an 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object using the same striding tuple as the original array used.
 Therefore, a regular indexing expression on an 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 can always produce an 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object 
\emph on
without
\emph default
 copying any data.
 This is sometimes referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 feature of array indexing, and one can see that it is enabled by the use
 of striding information in the underlying 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object.
 The greatest benefit of this feature is that it allows indexing to be done
 very rapidly and without exploding memory usage (because no copies of the
 data are made).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Universal Functions for arrays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NumPy provides a wealth of mathematical functions that operate on then ndarray
 object.
 From algebraic functions such as addition and multiplication to trigonometric
 functions such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos$
\end_inset

.
 Each universal function
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "universal function"

\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
ufunc
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ufunc"

\end_inset

) is an instance of a general class so that function behavior is the same.
 All ufuncs perform element-by-element operations over an array or a set
 of arrays (for multi-input functions).
 The ufuncs themselves and their methods are documented in Part 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "par:The-Ufunc-Object"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important aspect of ufunc behavior that should be introduced early,
 however, is the idea of 
\emph on

\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "broadcasting"

\end_inset

broadcasting
\emph default
.
 Broadcasting is used in several places throughout NumPy and is therefore
 worth early exposure.
 To understand the idea of broadcasting, you first have to be conscious
 of the fact that all ufuncs are always element-by-element operations.
 In other words, suppose we have a ufunc with two inputs and one output
 (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 addition) and the inputs are both arrays of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times5$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the output is going to be 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times5$
\end_inset

, and will be the result of applying the underlying function (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

) to each pair of inputs to produce the output at the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional location.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadcasting allows ufuncs to deal in a meaningful way with inputs that
 do not have exactly the same shape.
 In particular, the first rule of broadcasting is that if all input arrays
 do not have the same number of dimensions, then a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be repeatedly pre-pended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until
 all the arrays have the same number of dimensions.
 The second rule of broadcasting ensures that arrays with a size of 1 along
 a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the
 largest shape along that dimension.
 The value of the array element is assumed to be the same along that dimension
 for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

broadcasted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 array.
 After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must
 match.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a little tedious to explain, the broadcasting rules are easy to pick
 up by looking at a couple of examples.
 Suppose there is a 
\family typewriter
ufunc
\family default
 with two inputs, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Now supposed that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 has shape 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times5$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 has shape 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times1$
\end_inset

.
 The ufunc will proceed to compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times5$
\end_inset

 output as if 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 had been 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times5$
\end_inset

 by assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $B[...,k]=B[...,0]$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,2,3,4$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example illustrates the idea of adding 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

's to the beginning of the array shape-tuple.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the same as above, but 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a length 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 array.
 Because of the first rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 will be interpreted as a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times1\times5$
\end_inset

 array, and then because of the second rule 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 will be interpreted as a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times6\times5$
\end_inset

 array by repeating the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the obvious way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common alteration needed is to route-around the automatic pre-pending
 of 1's to the shape of the array.
 If it is desired, to add 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

's to the end of the array shape, then dimensions can always be added using
 the 
\family typewriter
newaxis
\family default
 name in NumPy: 
\begin_inset Formula $B[...,\textrm{newaxis, newaxis}]$
\end_inset

 returns an array with 2 additional 1's appended to the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $B.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important aspect of broadcasting is the calculation of functions on
 regularly spaced grids.
 For example, suppose it is desired to show a portion of the multiplication
 table by computing the function 
\begin_inset Formula $a*b$
\end_inset

 on a grid with 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 running from 6 to 9 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 running from 12 to 16.
 The following code illustrates how this could be done using ufuncs and
 broadcasting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = arange(6, 10); print a
\newline
[6 7 8 9]
\newline
>>> b = arange(12, 17); print b
\newline
[12
 13 14 15 16]
\newline
>>> table = a[:,newaxis] * b

>>> print table

\begin_layout Section
Summary of new features 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More information about using arrays in Python can be found in the old Numeric
 documentation at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "http://numeric.scipy.org"
target "http://numeric.scipy.org"

\end_inset

.
 Quite a bit of that documentation is still accurate, especially in the
 discussion of array basics.
 There are significant differences, however, and this book seeks to explain
 them in detail.
 The following list tries to summarize the significant new features (over
 Numeric) available in the 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ufunc
\family default
 objects of NumPy: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
more data types (all standard C-data types plus complex floats, Boolean,
 string, unicode, and void *);

many more array methods in addition to functional counterparts;
\end_layout

 parts of an array so that setting them changes the array itself);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
array scalars covering all data types which inherit from Python scalars
 when appropriate;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
arrays can be misaligned, swapped, and in Fortran order in memory (facilitates

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
arrays can be more easily read from text files and created from buffers
 and iterators;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
arrays can be quickly written to files in text and/or binary mode;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
arrays support the removal of the 64-bit memory limitation as long as you
 have Python 2.5 or later;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
fancy indexing can be done on arrays using integer sequences and Boolean
 masks;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
coercion rules are altered for mixed scalar / array operations so that scalars
 (anything that produces a 0-dimensional array internally) will not determine
 the output type in such cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
when coercion is needed, temporary buffer-memory allocation is limited to
 a user-adjustable size;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
errors are handled through the IEEE floating point status flags and there
 is flexibility on a per-thread level for handling these errors;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
one can register an error callback function in Python to handle errors are
 set to 'call' for their error handling;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ufunc reduce, accumulate, and reduceat can take place using a different
 type then the array type if desired (without copying the entire array);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ufunc output arrays passed in can be a different type than expected from
 the calculation;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ufuncs take keyword arguments which can specify 1) the error handling explicitly
 and 2) the specific 1-d loop to use by-passing the type-coercion detection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
arbitrary classes can be passed through ufuncs (__array_wrap__ and __array_prior
ity__ expand previous __array__ method);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ufuncs can be easily created from Python functions;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ufuncs have attributes to detail their behavior, including a dynamic doc
 string that automatically generates the calling signature;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
several new ufuncs (frexp, modf, ldexp, isnan, isfinite, isinf, signbit);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
new types can be registered with the system so that specialized ufunc loops
 can be written over new type objects;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
new types can also register casting functions and rules for fitting into
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can-cast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hierarchy;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
C-API enhanced so that more of the functionality is available from compiled
 code;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
C-API enhanced so array structure access can take place through macros;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
new iterator objects created for easy handling in C of non-contiguous arrays;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
new multi-iterator object created for easy handling in C of broadcasting;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
types have more functions associated with them (no magic function lists
 in the C-code).
 Any function needed is part of the type structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these enhancements will be documented more thoroughly in the remaining
 portions of this book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary of differences with Numeric
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An effort was made to retain backwards compatibility with Numeric all the
 way to the C-level.
 This was mostly accomplished, with a few changes that needed to be made
 for consistency of the new system.
 If you are just starting out with NumPy, then this section may be skipped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two steps (one required and one optional) to converting code that
 works with Numeric to work fully with NumPy The first step uses a compatibility
 layer and requires only small changes which can be handled by the numpy.oldnumer
ic.alter_code1 module.
 Code written to the compatibility layer will work and be supported.
 The purpose of the compatibility layer is to make it easy to convert to
 NumPy and many codes may only take this first step and work fine with NumPy.
 The second step is optional as it removes dependency on the compatibility
 layer and therefore requires a few more extensive changes.
 Many of these changes can be performed by the numpy.oldnumeric.alter_code2
 module, but you may still need to do some final tweaking by hand.
 Because many users will probably be content to only use the first step,
 the alter_code2 module for second-stage migration may not be as complete
 as it otherwise could be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
First-step changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the compatibility layer there are still a few changes that
 need to be made to your code.
 Many of these changes can be made by running the alter_code1 module with
 your code as input.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Importing (the alter_code1 module handles all these changes)

Some of the typecode characters have changed to be more consistent with
 other Python modules (array and struct).
 You should only notice this change if you used the actual typecode characters
 (instead of the named constants).
 
\newline
The alter_code1 module will change uses of 'b' to 'B' for internal Numeric
 functions that it knows about because NumPy will interpret 'b' to mean
 a signed byte type (instead of the old unsigned).
 It will also change the character codes when they are used explicitly in
 the .astype method.
 In the compatibility layer (and only in the compatibility layer), typecode-requ

If you used type-equality testing on the objects returned from arrays, then
 you need to change this to isinstance testing.
 Thus type(a[0]) is float or type(a[0]) == float should be changed to isinstance
(a[0], float).
 This is because array scalar objects are now returned from arrays.
 These inherit from the Python scalars where they can, but define their
 own methods and attributes.
 This conversion is done by alter_code1 for the types (float, int, complex,
 and ArrayType)

Arrays cannot be tested for truth value unless they are empty (returns False)

 This means that if Z: where Z is an array will fail (unless Z is empty

 Also the 'and' and 'or' operations (which test for object truth value)
 will also fail on arrays of more than one element.
 Use the .any() and .all() methods to test for truth value of an array.

If you used the construct 
\family typewriter

 You cannot set the shape of an array-scalar (you can read it though).
 As a result, for more general code you should use

arr=arr.reshape(<tuple>)
\family default
 which works for both array-scalars and arrays.

The typecode names are all lower-case and refer to type-objects corresponding
 to array scalars.
 The character codes are understood by array-creation functions but are
 not given names.
 All named type constants should be replaced with their lower-case equivalents.
 Also, the old character codes '1', 's', 'w', and 'u' are not understood
 as data-types.
 It is probably easiest to manually replace these with Int8, Int16, UInt16,
 and UInt32 and let the alter_code2 script convert the names to lower-case
 typeobjects.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The default data-type in NumPy is float unlike in Numeric (and numpy.oldnumeric)
 where it was int.
 There are several functions affected by this so that if your code was relying

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The nonzero function in NumPy returns a tuple of index arrays just like

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the long list of changes that might be needed given above, it is
 likely that your code does not use any of the incompatible corners and
 it should not be too difficult to convert from Numeric to NumPy.
 For example all of SciPy was converted in about 2-3 days.
 The needed changes are largely search-and replace type changes, and the
 alter_codeN modules can help.
 The modules have two functions which help the process:

Changes to think about 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if you don't make changes to your old code.
 If you are used to coding in Numeric, then you may need to adjust your
 coding style a bit.
 This list provides some helpful things to remember.
 
\end_layout

Switch from using typecode characters to bitwidth type names or c-type names
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The names for standard computations like Fourier transforms, linear algebra,
 and random-number generation have changed to conform to the standard of
 lower-case names possibly separated by an underscore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Look for ways to take advantage of advanced slicing, but remember it always
 returns a copy and may be slower at times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Remove any kludges you inserted to eliminate problems with Numeric that
 are now gone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Look for ways to take advantage of new features like expanded data-types
 (record-arrays).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
See if you can inherit from the ndarray directly, rather than using user_array.co
ntainer (UserArray).
 However, if you were using UserArray in a multiple-inheritance hierarchy
 this is going to be more difficult and you can continue to use the standard
 container class in user_array (but notice the name change).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Watch your usage of scalars extracted from arrays.
 Treating Numeric arrays like lists and then doing math on the elements
 1 by 1 was always about 2x slower than using real lists in Python.
 This can now be 3x-6x slower than using lists in NumPy because of the increased
 complexity of both the indexing of ndarrays and the math of array scalars.
 If you must select individual scalars from NumPy, you can get some speed
 increases by using the item method to get a standard Python scalar from
 an N-d array and by using the itemset method to place a scalar into a particula
r location in the N-d array.
 This complicates the appearance of the code, however.
 Also, when using these methods inside a loop, be sure to assign the methods
 to a local variable to avoid the attribute look-up at each loop iteration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this book, warnings are inserted when compatibility issues with
 old Numeric are raised.
 While you may not need to make any changes to get code to run with the
 ndarray object, you will likely want to make changes to take advantage
 of the new features of NumPy.
 If you get into a jam during the conversion process, you should be aware
 that Numeric and NumPy can both be used together and they will not interfere
 with each other.
 In addition, if you have Numeric 24.0 or newer, they can even share the
 same memory.
 This makes it easy to use NumPy as well as third-party tools that have
 not made the switch from Numeric yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary of differences with Numarray
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversion from Numarray can also be relatively painless, depending on how
 dependent your code is on the specific structure of the Numarray ufuncs,
 cfuncs, and various array-like objects.
 The internals of Numarray can be quite different and so depending on how
 intimately you used those internals adapting to NumPy can be more or less
 difficult.
 C-code that used the Numarray C-API can be easily adapted because NumPy
 includes a Numarray-compatible C-API module.
 All you need to do is replace usage of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

numarray/libnumarray.h
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

numpy/libnumarray.h
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and be sure the directory returned from the Python command numpy.get_numarray_in
clude() is included in the list of directories used for compilation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the Python-side the largest number of differences are in the methods
 and attributes of the array and the way array data-types are represented.
 In addition, arrays containing Python Objects, strings, and records are
 an integral part of the array object and not handled using a separate class
 (although enhanced separate classes do exist for the case of character
 arrays and record arrays).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is the case with Numeric, there is a two-step process available for migrating
 code written for Numarray to work with NumPy.
 This process involves running functions in the modules alter_code1 and
 alter_code2 located in the numarray sub-package of NumPy.
 These modules have interfaces identical to the ones that convert Numeric
 code, but they work to convert code written for numarray.
 The first module will convert your code to use the numarray compatibility
 module (numpy.numarray), while the second will try and help convert code
 to move away from dependency on the compatibility module.
 Because many users will probably be content to only use the first step,
 the alter_code2 module for second-stage migration may not be as complete
 as it otherwise could be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, the alter_code1 module is not guaranteed to convert every piece of
 working numarray code to use NumPy.
 If your code relied on the internal module structure of numarray or on
 how the class hierarchy was laid out, then it will need to be changed manually
 to run with NumPy.
 Of course you can still use your code with Numarray installed side-by-side
 and the two array objects should be able to exchange data without copying.

One of the notable differences is that several functions (array, arange,

 Instead you simply reshape the result using the reshape method.
 Another notable difference is that instead of allowing typecode=, type=,
 and dtype= variants for specifying the data-types, you must use the dtype=
 keyword.
 Other differences include

\begin_layout Subsection
Additional Extension modules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three extension packages that come included with numarray which
 are now downloaded separately.
 Stubs for these packages exist in numpy.numarray but they try and find the
 actual code by looking at what is currently installed.
 These packages are available in SciPy but can be installed separately as
 well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nd_image --> scipy.ndimage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
convolve --> scipy.stsci.convolve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
image --> scipy.stsci.image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't want to install all of scipy, you can grab just these packages
 from SVN using
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
svn co http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scipy/trunk/Lib/ndimage ndimage
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
svn co http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scipy/trunk/Lib/stsci stsci
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and then run
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd ndimage; sudo python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd stsci; sudo python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a Windows system, you can use the Tortoise SVN client which is integrated
 into the Windows Explorer.
 It can be downloaded from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org.
 Instructions on how to use it are also provided on that site.
 After downloading the packages from SVN, installation will still require
 a C-compiler (the mingw32 compiler works fine even with MSVC-compiled Python
 as long as you specify --compiler=mingw32).
 Alternatively you can download binary releases of scipy from http://www.scipy.org
 to get the needed functionality or use the Enthon edition of Python.

\InsetSpace ~
 Array flags
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_inset

 provide information about how the memory area used for the array is to
 be interpreted.
 There are 6 Boolean flags in use which govern whether or not:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
C_CONTIGUOUS\InsetSpace ~
(C) the data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
F_CONTIGUOUS\InsetSpace ~
(F) the data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
OWNDATA\InsetSpace ~
(O) the array owns the memory it uses or if it borrows it from another
 object (if this is False, the base attribute retrieves a reference to the
 object this array obtained its data from);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
WRITEABLE\InsetSpace ~
(W) the data area can be written to;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ALIGNED\InsetSpace ~
(A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the hardware
 (as determined by the compiler);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
UPDATEIFCOPY\InsetSpace ~
(U) this array is a copy of some other array (referenced by
 
\family typewriter
.base
\family default
).
 When this array is deallocated, the base array will be updated with the
 contents of this array.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Only the 
\series bold
UPDATEIFCOPY
\series default
, 
\series bold
WRITEABLE
\series default
, and 
\series bold
ALIGNED
\series default
 flags can be changed by the user.
 This can be done using the special array-connected, dictionary-like object
 that the flags attribute returns.
 By setting elements in this dictionary, the underlying array obect's flags
 are altered.
 Flags can also be changed using the method 
\family typewriter
setflags
\family default
(...).
 All flags in the dictionary can be accessed using their first (upper case)
 letter as well as the full name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Certain logical combinations of flags can also be read using named keys
 to the special flags dictionary.
 These combinations are
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
FNC Returns F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
FORC Returns F_CONTIGUOUS or C_CONTIGUOUS (one-segment test).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
BEHAVED\InsetSpace ~
(B) Returns ALIGNED and WRITEABLE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CARRAY\InsetSpace ~
(CA) Returns BEHAVED and C_CONTIGUOUS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
FARRAY_(FA) Returns BEHAVED and F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Note
The array flags cannot be set arbitrarily.
 UPDATEIFCOPY can only be set False.
 the ALIGNED flag can only be set True if the data is truly aligned.
 The flag WRITEABLE can only be set True if the array owns its own memory
 or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer interface
 (or is a string).
 The exception for string is made so that unpickling can be done without
 copying memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Flags can also be set and read using attribute access with the lower-case
 key equivalent (without first letter support).
 Thus, for example, self.flags.c_contiguous returns whether or not the array
 is C-style contiguous, and self.flags.writeable=True changes the array to
 be writeable (if possible)
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!flags|)"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
shape
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!shape"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The shape of the array is a tuple giving the number of elements in each
 dimension.
 The shape can be reset for single-segment arrays by setting this attribute
 to another tuple.
 The total number of elements cannot change.
 However, a -1 may be used in a dimension entry to indicate that the array
 length in that dimension should be computed so that the total number of
 elements does not change.
 
\family typewriter
a.shape=x
\family default
 is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
a=a.reshape(x)
\family default
 except the latter can be used even if the array is not single-segment and
 even if 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is an array scalar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
Setting the shape attribute to () for a 1-element array will turn self into
 a 0-dimensional array.
 This is one of the few ways to get a 0-dimensional array in Python.
 Most other operations will return an array scalar.
 Other ways to get a 0-dimensional array in Python include calling array
 with a scalar argument and calling the squeeze method of an array whose
 shape is all 1's.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
strides
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!strides"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The strides of an array is a tuple showing for each dimension how many
 
\emph on
bytes
\emph default
 must be skipped to get to the next element in that dimension.
 Setting this attribute to another tuple will change the way the memory
 is viewed.
 This attribute can only be set to a tuple that will not cause the array
 to access unavailable memory.
 If an attempt is made to do so, ValueError is raised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ndim
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!ndim"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The number of dimensions of an array is sometimes called the rank of the
 array.
 Getting this attribute reveals the length of the shape tuple and the strides
 tuple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
data
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!data"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A buffer object referencing the actual data for this array if this array
 is single-segment.
 If the array is not single-segment, then an AttributeError is raised.
 The buffer object is writeable depending on the status of self.flags.writeable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
size
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!size"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The total number of elements in the array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
itemsize
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!itemsize"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The number of bytes each element of the array requires.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
nbytes
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!nbytes"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The total number of bytes used by the array.
 This is equal to 
\family typewriter
self.itemsize*self.size
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
base
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!base"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If the array does not own its own memory, then this attribute returns the
 object whose memory this array is referencing.
 The returned object may not be the original allocator of the memory, but
 may be borrowing it from still another object.
 If this array does own its own memory, then None is returned unless the
 UPDATEIFCOPY flag is True in which case self.base is the array that will
 be updated when self is deleted.
 UPDATEIFCOPY gets set for an array that is created as a behaved copy of
 a general array.
 The intent is for the misaligned array to get any changes that occur to
 the copy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Type attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways to specify the kind of data that the array is composed
 of.
 The fullest description that preserves field information is always obtained
 using an actual dtype object.
 See Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Data-descriptor-objects"

\end_inset

 for more discussion on data-type objects and acceptable arguments to construct
 data-type objects.
 Three commonly-used attributes of the data-type object returned are also
 documented here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dtype
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!dtype"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A data-type object that fully describes (including any defined fields)
 each fixed-length item in the array.
 Whether or not the data is in machine byte-order is also determined by
 the data-type.
 The data-type attribute can be set to anything that can be interpreted
 as a data-type (see Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Data-descriptor-objects"

\end_inset

 for more information).
 Setting this attribute allows you to change the interpretation of the data
 in the array.
 The new data-type must be compatible with the array's current data-type.
 The new data-type is compatible if it has the same itemsize as the current
 data-type descriptor, or (if the array is a single-segment array) if the
 the array with the new data-type fits in the memory already consumed by
 the array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dtype.type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A Python type object gives the typeobject whose instances represent elements
 of the array.
 This type object can be used to instantiate a scalar of that type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dtype.char
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A typecode character unique to each of the 21 built-in types.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dtype.str
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This string consists of a required first character giving the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

endianness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the data (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for little endian, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for big endian, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

|
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for irrelevant), the second character is a code for the kind of data ('b'
 for Boolean, 'i' for signed integer, 'u' for unsigned integer, 'f' for
 floating-point, 'c' for complex floating point, 'O' for object, 'S' for
 ASCII string, 'U' for unicode, and 'V' for void), the final characters
 give the number of bytes each element uses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
T
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!T"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Equivalent to self.transpose().
 For self.ndim < 2, it returns a view of self.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
If arr is 0- or 1-dimensional, then arr.T will return a new ndarray which
 refers to the same data as arr.
 This is because transpose has the effect of reversing the shape attribute
 of an array (whose 0-d and 1-d equivalent is to return the same array).
 This may be surprising if you are thinking of your 1-d array as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

row
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

column
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vector and expected the .T attribute to return the other convention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
real
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!real"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The real part of an array.
 For arrays that are not complex this attribute returns the array itself.
 Setting this attribute allows setting just the real part of an array.
 If the array is already real then setting this attribute is equivalent
 to self[...] = values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
imag
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!imag"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A view of the imaginary part of an array.
 For arrays that are not complex, this returns a read-only array of zeros.
 Setting this array allows in-place alteration of the complex part of an
 imaginary array.
 If the array is not complex, then trying to set this attribute raises an
 Error.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
flat
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!flat"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return an iterator object (numpy.flatiter) that acts like a 1-d version
 of the array.
 1-d indexing works on this array and it can be passed in to most routines
 as an array wherein a 1-d array will be constructed from it.
 The new 1-d array will reference this array's data if this array is C-style
 contiguous, otherwise, new memory will be allocated for the 1-d array,
 the UPDATEIFCOPY flag will be set for the new array, and this array will
 have its WRITEABLE flag set FALSE until the the last reference to the new
 array disappears.
 When the last reference to the new 1-d array disappears, the data will
 be copied over to this non-contiguous array.
 This is done so that a.flat effectively references the current array regardless
 of whether or not it is contiguous or non-contiguous.
 As an example, consider the following code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = zeros((4,5))
\newline
>>> b = ones(6)
\newline
>>> add(b,b,a[1:3,0:3].flat)
\newline
array([[ 2.,
  2.,  2.],
\newline
       [ 2.,  2.,  2.]])
\newline
>>> print a
\newline
[[ 0.

  0.
  0.
  0.]
\newline
 [ 2.

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The numpy.flatiter object has two methods: 
\series bold
__array__()
\series default
 and 
\series bold
copy()
\series default
 and one attribute: 
\series bold
base
\series default
.
 The base attribute returns a reference to the underlying array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__array_priority__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!\\_\\_array\\_priority\\_\\_"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The array priority attribute is a floating point number useful in mixed
 operations involving two subtypes to decide which subtype is returned.
 The base ndarray object has priority 0.0 and 1.0 is the default subtype priority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Array Interface attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The array interface
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "array interface"

\end_inset

 (sometimes called array protocol) was created in 2005 as a means for array-like
 Python objects to re-use each other's data buffers intelligently whenever
 possible.
 The ndarray object supports both the Python-side and the C-side of the
 array interface.
 The system is able to consume objects that expose the array interface,
 and array objects can expose their inner workings to other objects that
 support the array interface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__array_interface__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!\\_\\_array\\_interface\\_\\_"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The python-side of the array interface.
 It is a dictionary with the following attributes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
data A 2-tuple (dataptr, read-only flag).
 The dataptr is a string giving the address (in hexadecimal format) of the
 array data.
 The read-only flag is True if the array memory is read-only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
strides The strides tuple.
 Same as 
\series bold
strides
\series default
 attribute except None is returned if the array is C-style contiguous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
shape The shape tuple.
 Same as 
\series bold
shape
\series default
 attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
typestr A string giving the format of the data.
 Same as 
\series bold
dtype.str
\series default
 attribute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
descr A list of tuples providing the detailed description of this data type.
 This information is obtained from the arrdescr attribute of the dtypedescr
 object associated with each array.
 For arrays with fields, this will return a valid array-protocol descriptor
 list.
 For arrays without defined fields, this returns [('',typestr)].
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
__array_struct__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!\\_\\_array\\_struct\\_\\_"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A PyCObject that wraps a pointer to a PyArrayInterface structure.
 This is only useful on the C-level for rapid implementation of the array
 interface, using a single attribute lookup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ctypes
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!ctypes|("

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This attribute creates an object that makes it easier to use arrays when
 calling out to shared libraries with the ctypes module.
 The returned object has data, shape, and strides attributes which return
 ctypes
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ctypes"

\end_inset

 objects that can be used as arguments to a shared library.
 These attributes are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
data A pointer to the memory area of the array as a Python integer.
 This memory area may contain data that is not aligned, or not in correct
 byte-order.
 The memory area may not even be writeable.
 The array flags and data-type of this array should be respected when passing
 this attribute to arbitrary C-code to avoid trouble that can include Python
 crashing.
 User Beware! The value of this attribute is exactly the same as 
\family typewriter
self.__array_interface__['data'][0]
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
shape (c_intp*self.ndim) A ctypes array of length self.ndim where the base-type
 is the C-integer corresponding to dtype('p') on this platform.
 This base-type could be c_int, c_long, or c_longlong depending on the platform.
 The c_intp type is defined accordingly in numpy.ctypeslib.
 The ctypes array contains the shape of the underlying array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
strides (c_intp*self.ndim) A ctypes array of length self.ndim where the base-type
 is the same as for the shape attribute.
 This ctypes array contains the strides information from the underlying
 array.
 This strides information is important for showing how many bytes must be
 jumped to get to the next element in the array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
_as_parameter_ (c_void_p) Returns the data-pointer to the array as a ctypes
 object.
 Among other possible uses, this enables this ctypes object to be used directly
 in a ctypes-loaded call to an arbitrary function.
 Be sure to respect the flags on the array and the size and strides of the
 array so as not to use this memory in-appropriately (see the 
\series bold
ndpointer
\series default
 function for how to return a class that can be used with the argtypes attribute
 of ctypes functions).
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Warning
Be careful using the ctypes attribute --- especially on temporary arrays
 or arrays constructed on the fly.
 For example, calling (a+b).ctypes.data_as(ctypes.c_void_p) returns a pointer
 to memory that is invalid because the array created as (a+b) is deallocated
 before the next Python statement.
 You can avoid this problem using either c=a+b or ct=(a+b).ctypes.
 In the latter case, ct will hold a reference to the array until ct is deleted
 or re-assigned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The ctypes object also has several methods which can alter how the shape,
 strides, and data of the underlying object is returned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
data_as (obj) Return the data pointer cast-to a particular c-types object.
 For example, calling 
\family typewriter
self._as_parameter_
\family default
 is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
self.data_as(ctypes.c_void_p)
\family default
.
 Perhaps you want to use the data as a pointer to a ctypes array of floating-poi
nt data: 
\family typewriter
self.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_double))
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
shape_as (obj) Return the shape tuple as an array of some other c-types
 type.
 For example: 
\family typewriter
self.shape_as(ctypes.c_short)
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
strides_as (obj) Return the strides tuple as an array of some other c-types
 type.
 For example: 
\family typewriter
self.strides_as(ctypes.c_longlong)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If the ctypes module is not available, then the ctypes attribute of array
 objects still returns something useful, but ctypes objects are not returned
 and errors may be raised instead.
 In particular, the object will still have the _as_parameter_ attribute
 which will return an integer equal to the data
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes!ctypes|)"

\end_inset

 attribute
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!attributes|)"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In NumPy, the 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object has many methods
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods|("

\end_inset

 which operate on or with the array in some fashion, typically returning
 an array result.
 In Numeric, many of these methods were only library calls.
 These methods are explained in this chapter.
 Whenever the array whose method is being called needs to be referenced
 it will be referred to as 
\emph on
this array
\emph default
, or 
\emph on
self
\emph default
.
 Keyword arguments will be shown.
 Methods that only take one argument do not have keyword arguments.
 Default values for one argument methods will be shown in braces {default}.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
If you are converting code from Numeric, then you will need to make the
 following (search and replace) conversions: 
\family typewriter
.typecode() --> .dtype.char
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
.iscontiguous() --> .flags.contiguous
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
.byteswapped() --> .byteswap()
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
.toscalar() --> .item()
\family default
; and 
\family typewriter
.itemsize() --> .itemsize
\family default
.
 The numpy.oldnumeric.alter_code1 module can automate this for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Array conversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
tolist
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!tolist"

\end_inset

 ()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The contents of self as a nested list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]); print a.tolist()
\newline
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
item
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!item"

\end_inset

 (*args)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If no arguments are passed in, then this method only works for arrays with
 one element (a.size == 1).
 In this case, it returns a standard Python scalar object (if possible)
 copied from the first element of self.
 When the data type of self is longdouble or clongdouble, this returns a
 scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that would
 not lose information.
 Void arrays return a buffer object for item() unless fields are defined
 in which case a tuple is returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> asc = a[0,0].item()
\newline
>>> type(asc)
\newline
<type 'int'>
\newline
>>> asc
\newline
1
\newline
>>> type(a[0,0])
\newline
<type
 'numpy.int32'>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If arguments are provided, then they indicate indices into the array (either
 a flat index or an nd-index).
 A standard Python scalar corresponding to the item at the given location
 is then returned.
 This is very similar to self[args] except instead of an array scalar, a
 standard Python scalar is returned.
 This can be useful for speeding up access to elements of the array and
 doing arithmetic on elements of the array using Python's optimized math.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
itemset
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!itemset"

\end_inset

 (*args)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 There must be at least 1 argument and define the last argument as item.
 Then, this is equivalent to but faster than self[args] = item.
 The item should be a scalar value and args must select a single item in
 the array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
tostring
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!tostring"

\end_inset

 (order='C')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A Python string showing a copy of the raw contents of data memory.
 The string can be produced in either 'C' or 'Fortran', or 'Any' order (the
 default is 'C'-order).
 'Any' order means C-order unless the F_CONTIGUOUS flag in the array is
 set, then 'Fortran' order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
tofile
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!tofile"

\end_inset

 (file=, sep='', format='')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Write the contents of self to the open file object.
 If file is a string, then open a file of that name first.
 If sep is the empty string, then write the file in binary mode.
 If sep is any other string, write the array in simple text mode separating
 each element with the value of the sep string.
 When the file is written in text mode, the format string can be used to
 alter the appearance of each entry.
 If format is the empty string, then it is equivalent to 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

%s
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
.
 Each element of the array will be converted to a Python scalar, 
\family typewriter
o
\family default
, and written to the file as 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 % o
\family default
.
 Note that writing an array to a file does not store any information about
 the shape, type, or endianness of an array.
 When written in binary mode, tofile is functionally equivalent to 
\family typewriter
fid.write(self.tostring())
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a.tofile('myfile.txt',sep=':',format='%03d')
\end_layout

dump
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!dump"

\end_inset

 (file)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Pickle the contents of self to the file object represented by file.
 Equivalent to cPickle.dump(self, file, 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dumps
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!dumps"

\end_inset

 ()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return pickled representation of self as a string.
 Equivalent to cPickle.dumps(self, 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
astype
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!astype"

\end_inset

 ({None})
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Force conversion of this array to an array with the data type provided
 as the argument.
 If the argument is None, or equal to the data type of self, then return
 a copy of the array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
byteswap
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!byteswap"

\end_inset

 ({False})
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Byteswap the elements of the array and return the byteswapped array.
 If the argument is True, then byteswap in-place and return a reference
 to self.
 Otherwise, return a copy of the array with the elements byteswapped.
 The data-type descriptor is not changed so the array will have changed
 numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
copy
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!copy"

\end_inset

 ()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return a copy of the array (which is always single-segment, and ALIGNED).
 However, the data-type is preserved (including whether or not the data
 is byteswapped).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
view
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!view"

\end_inset

 ({None})
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return a new array using the same memory area as self.
 If the optional argument is given, it can be either a typeobject that is
 a sub-type of the ndarray or an object that can be converted to a data-type
 descriptor.
 If the argument is a typeobject then a new array of that Python type is
 returned that uses the information from self.
 If the argument is a data-type descriptor, then a new array of the same
 Python type as self is returned using the given data-type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> print a.view(single)

       [4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0,
 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
getfield
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!getfield"

\end_inset

 (dtype=, offset=0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return a 
\emph on
field
\emph default
 of the given array as an array of the given data type.
 A field is a view of the array's data at a certain byte offset interpreted
 as a given data type.
 The returned array is a reference into self, therefore changes made to
 the returned array will be reflected in self.
 This method is particularly useful for record arrays that use a void data
 type, but it can also be used to extract the low (high)-order bytes of
 other array types as well.
 For example, using getfield, you could extract fixed-length substrings
 from an array of strings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = array(['Hello','World','NumPy'])
\newline
>>> a.getfield('S2',1)
\newline
array(['el',
 'or', 'um'], 
\newline
      dtype='|S2')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
setflags
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!setflags"

\end_inset

 (write=None, align=None, uic=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, and UPDATEIFCOPY, respectively.
 The ALIGNED flag can only be set to True if the data is actually aligned
 according to the type.
 The UPDATEIFCOPY flag can never be set to True.
 The flag WRITEABLE can only be set True if the array owns its own memory
 or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer interface
 (or is a string).
 The exception for string is made so that unpickling can be done without
 copying memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
fill
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!fill"

\end_inset

 (scalar)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Fill an array with the scalar value (appropriately converted to the type
 of self).
 If the scalar value is an array or a sequence, then only the first element
 is used.
 This method is usually faster than a[...]=scalar or self.flat=scalar, and always
 interprets its argument as a scalar.

\begin_layout Subsection
Array shape manipulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For reshape, resize, and transpose, the single tuple argument may be replaced
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 integers which will be interpreted as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-tuple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
reshape
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!reshape"

\end_inset

 (newshape, order='C')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return an array that uses the same data as this array but has a new shape
 given by the newshape tuple (or a scalar to reshape as 1-d).
 The new shape must define an array with the same total number of elements.
 If one of the elements of the new shape tuple is -1, then that dimension
 will be determined such that the overall number of items in the array stays
 constant.
 If possible, the new array will reference the data of the old one.
 If the data must be moved in order to accomplish the reshape, then then
 the new array will contain a copy of the data in self.
 The order argument specifies how the array data should be viewed during
 the reshape (either in 'C' or 'FORTRAN' order).
 This order argument specifies both how the intrinsic raveling to a 1-d
 array should occur as well as how that 1-d array should be used to fill-up
 the new output array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
resize
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!resize"

\end_inset

 (newshape, refcheck=1, order='C')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Resize an array in-place.
 This changes self (in-place) to be an array with the new shape, reallocating
 space for the data area if necessary.
 If the data memory must be changed because the number of new elements is
 different than self.size, then an error will occur if this array does not
 own its data or if another object is referencing this one.
 Only a single-segment array can be resized.
 The method returns None.
 To bypass the reference count check, then set refcheck=0.
 The purpose of the reference count check is to make sure you don't use
 this array as a buffer for another Python object and then reallocate the
 memory.
 However, reference counts can increase in other ways so if you are sure
 that you have not shared the memory for this array to another Python object,
 then you may safely set refcheck=0.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
transpose
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!transpose"

\end_inset

 (<None>)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return an array view with the shape transposed according to the argument.
 An argument of None is equivalent to range(self.ndim)[::-1].
 The argument can either be a tuple or multiple integer arguments.
 This method returns a new array with permuted shape and strides attributes
 using the same data as self.

\begin_layout Subsection
Array item selection and manipulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For array methods that take an axis keyword, it defaults to None.
 If axis is None, then the array is treated as a 1-D array.
 Any other value for axis represents the dimension along which the operation
 should proceed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
take
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!take"

\end_inset

 (indices=, axis=None, out=None, mode='raise')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The functionality of this method is available using the advanced indexing
 ability of the 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 object.
 However, for doing selection along a single axis it is usually faster to
 use take.
 If axis is not None, this method is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
self[indxobj]
\family default
 preceeded by 
\family typewriter
indxobj=[slice(None)]*self.ndim; indxobj[
\series bold
axis
\series default
] =
\family default
 
\family typewriter
\series bold
indices
\family default
\series default
.
 It returns the elements or sub-arrays from self indicated by the index
 numbers in indices.
 If axis is None, then this method is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
self.flat[indices]
\family default
.
 The out and mode arguments allow for specification of the output array
 and how out-of-bounds indices will be handled ('raise': raise an error,
 'wrap': wrap around, 'clip': clip to range)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~

 The mode argument specifies what to do if n is too large.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
repeat
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!repeat"

\end_inset

 (repeats=, axis=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Copy elements (or sub-arrays selected along axis) of self 
\series bold
repeats
\series default
 times.
 The repeats argument must be a sequence of length self.shape[axis] or a
 scalar.
 The repeats argument dictates how many times the element (or sub-array)
 will be repeated in the result array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
choose
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!choose"

\end_inset

 (choices, out=None, mode='raise')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The array must be an integer (or bool) array with entries from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Choices is a tuple of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 choice arrays: 
\begin_inset Formula $b0,\, b1,\,\ldots\,,\, bn$
\end_inset

.
 (Alternatively, choices can be replaced with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 arguments where each argument is a choice array).
 The return array will be formed from the elements of the choice arrays
 according to the value of the elements of self.
 In other words, the output array will merge the choice arrays together
 by using the value of self at a particular position to select which choice
 array should be used for the output at a particular position.
 The out keyword allows specification of an output array and the clip keyword
 allows different behavior when self contains entries outside the number
 of choices.
 The acceptable arguments to mode are 'raise' (RAISE), 'wrap' (WRAP), and
 'clip' (CLIP) ('raise' produces an error, 'wrap' converts the number into
 range by periodic wrapping so that numbers <0 have 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 repeatedly added and numbers >= 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 have 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 repeatedly subtracted, and 'clip' will clip all entries to be within the
 range [0,
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = array([0,3,2,1])
\newline

\begin_layout Description
sort
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!sort"

\end_inset

 (axis=-1, kind='quick', order=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Sort the array in-place and return None.
 The sort takes place over the given axis using an underlying sort algorithm
 specified by kind.
 The sorting algorithms available are 'quick', 'heap', and 'merge'.
 For flexible types only the quicksort algorithm is available.
 For arrays with fields defined, the order keyword allows specification
 of the order in which to use the field names in the sort.
 If order is a string then it is the field name to use to define the sort.
 If order is a list (or tuple) of strings, then it specifies a lexicographic
 ordering so that the first listed field name is compared first if that
 results in equality, the second listed field name is used for the comparison
 and so on.
 If order is None, then arrays with fields use the first field for comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a=array([[0.2,1.3,2.5],[1.5,0.1,1.4]]);

\begin_layout Description
argsort
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!argsort"

\end_inset

 (axis=-1, kind='quick', order=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return an index array of the same size as self showing which indices along
 the given axis should be selected to sort self along that axis.
 Uses an underlying sort algorithm specified by kind.
 The sorting algorithms available are 'quick', 'heap', and 'merge'.
 For arrays with fields defined, the order keyword allows specification
 of the order in which to use the field names in the sort.
 If order is a string then it is the field name to use to define the sort.
 If order is a list (or tuple) of strings, then it specifies a lexicographic
 ordering so that the first listed field name is compared first if that
 results in equality, the second listed field name is used for the comparison
 and so on.
 If order is None, then arrays with fields use the first field for comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> b=a.copy(); print b.argsort(0)
\newline
[[0 1 1]
\newline
 [1 0 0]]
\newline
>>> b=a.copy(); print b.argsort(1
)
\newline
[[0 1 2]
\newline
 [1 2 0]]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Tip
Complex valued arrays sort lexicographically by comparing first the real
 parts and then the imaginary parts if the real parts are the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
searchsorted
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!searchsorted"

\end_inset

 (values, side='left')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return an index array (dtype=intp) of the same shape as values showing
 the index where the value would fit in self.
 The index is such that self[index-1] 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 value 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

 self[index] when side is 'left'.
 In this formula self[self.size]=
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

 and self[-1]=
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, if value is larger than all elements of self, then index is
 self.size.
 If value is smaller than all elements of self, then index is 0.
 Self must be a sorted 1-d array.
 If elements of self are repeated, the index of the first occurrence is
 used.
 If side is 'right', then the search rule is switched so that the 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 sign is on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of the left in the search rule.
 In other words, the index returned is such that self[index-1] 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

value 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 self[index].
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional indices for elements of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional array self that are nonzero into an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-tuple of equal-length index arrays.
 In particular, notice that a 0-dimensional array always returns an empty
 tuple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode

\begin_layout Description
compress
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!methods!compress"

\end_inset

 (condition=, axis=None, out=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This method expects condition to be a one-dimensional mask array of the
 same length as self.shape[axis].
 If the array is less than self.shape[axis], then False is assumed for the
 missing elements.
 The method returns the elements (or sub-arrays along the given axis) of
 self where condition is true.
 The shape of the return array is self.shape with the axis dimension replaced
 by the number of True elements of condition.
 The same effect can often be accomplished using array indexing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> x=array([0,1,2,3])

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If self is 2-d, return the 
\series bold

\series default
 (from the main diagonal) diagonal of self.
 If self is larger than 2-d, then return an array constructed from all the
 diagonals created from all the 2-d sub-arrays formed using all of axis1
 and axis2.
 The offset parameter is with respect to axis2.
 The shape of the returned array is found by removing the axis1 and axis2
 entries from self.shape and then appending the length of the offset diagonal
 of each 2-d sub-array.

\begin_layout Subsection
Array calculation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of these methods take an argument named axis.
 In such cases, if axis is None (the default), the array is treated as a
 1-d array and the operation is performed over the entire array.
 This behavior is also the default if self is a 0-dimensional array or array
 scalar.
 If axis is an integer, then the operation is done over the given axis (for
 each 1-d subarray that can be created along the given axis).
 The parameter dtype specifies the data type over which a reduction operation
 (like summing) should take place.
 The default reduce data type is the same as the data type of self.
 To avoid overflow, it can be useful to perform the reduction using a larger
 data type.
 For several methods, an optional out argument can be provided and the result
 will be placed into the output array given.
 The out argument must be an ndarray and have the same number of elements.
 It can be of a different type in which case casting will be performed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return the largest value in self.
 This is a better way to compute the maximum over an array, than using max(self).
 The latter uses the generic sequence interface to self.
 This will be slower, and will try to get an answer by comparing whole sub-array
s of self.
 This will be incorrect for arrays larger than 1-d.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (axis=None, out=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return the smallest value in self.
 This is a better way to compute the minimum over an array, than using min(self).
 The latter uses the generic sequence interface to self.
 This will be slower, and will try to get an answer by comparing whole sub-array
s of self.
 This will be incorrect for arrays larger than 1-d.

 This is equivalent to (self**2).mean - self.mean()**2 and ((self-self.mean())**2).m
ean().
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 was not chosen for normalization because while it gives an

 in this chapter are not generally meant to be called directly by the user.
 They are called by Python and are used to customize behavior of the ndarray
 object as it interacts with the Python language and standard library.

\begin_layout Description
__copy__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!copy"

\end_inset

 ()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 To allow copy.copy(a) to perform a shallow copy of an array.
 Exactly the same as self.copy() (contents of object arrays are not copied).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__deepcopy__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!deepcopy"

\end_inset

 (memodict)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 To allow copy.deepcopy(a) to perform a deep copy.
 This is the same as a shallow copy unless self is an object array.
 Then, after the shallow copy is made, a copy.deepcopy(item) is called for
 every item in the object array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__reduce__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!reduce"

\end_inset

 ()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__setstate__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!setstate"

\end_inset

 (shape, typestr, isfortran, data)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Pickling support for arrays is provided by these two methods.
 When an array needs to be pickled, the __reduce__() method is called to
 provide a 3-tuple of already-pickleable objects.
 To construct a new object from the pickle, the first two elements of the
 3-tuple are used to construct a new (0-length) array of the correct type
 and the last element of the 3-tuple, which is itself a 4-tuple of (shape,
 typestr, isfortran, data) is passed to the __setstate__ method of the newly
 created array to restore its contents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The reduce method returns a 3-tuple consisting of (callable, args, state)
 where callable is a simple constructor function that handles subclasses
 of the ndarray.
 Also, args is a 3-tuple of arguments to pass to this constructor function
 (type(self), (0,), self.dtypechar), and state is a 4-tuple of information
 giving the object's state (self.shape, self.dtypedescr, isfortran, string_or_list
).
 In this tuple, isfortran is a Bool stating whether the following flattened
 data is in Fortran order or not, and string_or_list is a string formed
 by self.tostring() if the data type is not object.
 If the data type of self is an object array, then string_or_list is a flat
 list equivalent to self.ravel().tolist().
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 On load from a pickle, the pickling code uses the first two elements from
 the tuple returned by reduce to construct an empty 0-dimensional subclass
 of the correct type.
 The last element is then passed to the __setstate__ method of the newly
 created array to restore its contents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
When data is a string, the __setstate__ method will directly use the string
 memory as the array memory (new.base will point to the string).
 The typestr contains enough information to decode how the memory should
 be interpreted.

\begin_layout Description
__new__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!new"

\end_inset

 (subtype, shape=, dtype=long_, buffer=None, offset=0, strides=None, order=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This method creates a new ndarray.
 It is typically only used in the __new__ method of a subclass.
 This method is called to construct a new array whenever the object name
 is called, 
\family typewriter
a=ndarray(...)
\family default
.
 It supports two basic modes of array creation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a single-segment array of the specified shape and data-type from newly allocated
 memory;
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
uses shape, dtype, strides, and order arguments; others are ignored;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The order argument allows specification of a Fortran-style contiguous memory
 segment (order='Fortran');
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If strides is given, then it specifies the new strides of the array (and
 the order keyword is ignored).
 The strides will be checked for consistency with the dimension size so
 that steps outside of the memory won't occur.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
an array of the given shape and data type using the provided object, buffer,
 which must export the buffer interface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
all arguments can be used;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
strides can be given and will be checked for consistency with the shape,
 data type, and available memory in buffer;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
order indicates whether the data buffer should be interpreted as Fortran-style
 contiguous (order='Fortran') or not;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
offset can be used to start the array data at some offset in the buffer.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Note
The ndarray uses the default no-op __init__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!init"

\end_inset

 function because the array is completely initialized after __new__ is called.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__array__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!array"

\end_inset

 Useful for subclasses that need to get to the ndarray object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__array_wrap__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!array\\_wrap"

\end_inset

 (arr)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This is a special method that always returns an object of the same Python
 type as self using the array passed as an argument.
 This is mainly useful for subclasses as it is an easy way to get the subclass
 back from an ndarray.

\begin_layout Description
__repr__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!repr"

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 These functions print the array when called by str(self) and repr(self)
 respectively.
 Array printing can be changed using set_string_function(..).
 Default array printing has been borrowed from numarray whose printing code
 was written by Perry Greenfield and J.
 Todd Miller.
 By default, arrays print such that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The last axis is always printed left to right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The next-to-last axis is printed top to bottom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Remaining axes are printed top to bottom with increasing numbers of separators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Five parameters of the printing can be set using keyword arguments with
 
\family typewriter
set_printoptions(...)
\family default
.
 The parameters
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

 are
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
precision the number of digits of precision for floating point output (default
 8);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
threshold total number of array elements which triggers summarization rather
 than full representation (default 1000);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
edgeitems number of array items in summary at beginning an end of each dimension
 (default 3);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
linewidth the number of characters per line for the purpose of inserting
 line breaks (default 71);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
suppress Boolean indicating whether or not to suppress printing of small
 floating point values using scientific notation (default False).
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
__nonzero__
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!nonzero"

\end_inset

 ()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Truth-value testing for the array as a whole.
 It is called whenever the truth value of the ndarray as a whole object
 is required.
 This raises an error if the number of elements in the the array is larger
 than 1 because the truth value of such arrays is ambiguous.
 Use .any() and .all() instead to be clear about what is meant in such cases.
 If the number of elements is 0 then False is returned.
 If there is one element in the array, then the truth-value of this element
 is returned.

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Returns self.shape[0].
 It is called in response to len(self).
 Use self.size to get the total number of elements in the array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Notice that the default Python iterator for sequences is used when arrays
 are used in places that expect an iterator.
 This iterator returns successively self[0], self[1], ..., self[self.__len__()].
 Use self.flat to get an iterator that walks through the entire array one
 element at a time.

 Using inplace operations can save space and time and is therefore encouraged
 whenever appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
In place operations will perform the calculation using the precision decided
 by the data type of the two operands, but will silently downcast the result
 (if necessary) so it can fit back into the array.
 Therefore, for mixed precision calculations, a <op>= B can be different
 than a = a <op> B.
 For example, suppose a=ones((3,3)).
 Then a+=3j is different than a=a+3j While they both perform the same computatio
n, a+=3j casts the result to fit back in a, while a=a+3j re-binds the name
 a to the result.

\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_inset

 was an important extension introduced by numarray, and was therefore an
 important part of the development of NumPy.
 In particular, the desire to select arbitrary elements based on their position
 in the array, and according to a mask was desirable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two kinds of indexing available using the 
\family typewriter
X[obj]
\family default
 syntax: basic slicing, and advanced indexing
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!setitem"

\end_inset

.
 For the description of this syntax given below, X is the array to-be-sliced
 and obj is the 
\emph on
selection
\emph default
 object.
 Furthermore, define 
\begin_inset Formula $N\equiv$
\end_inset

X.ndim.
 These two methods of slicing have different behavior and are triggered
 depending on obj.
 Adding additional functionality yet remaining compatible with old uses
 of slicing complicated the rules a little.
 Hopefully, after studying this section, you will have a firm grasp of what
 kind of selection will be initiated depending on the selection object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Tip
in Python X[(exp1, exp2, ..., expN)] is equivalent to X[exp1, exp2, ..., expN]
 as the latter is just syntactic sugar for the former.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic Slicing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basic slicing
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!getslice"

\end_inset

 extends Python's basic concept of slicing
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!special methods!setslice"

\end_inset

 to N dimensions.
 Basic slicing occurs when obj is a slice object (constructed by start:stop:step
 notation inside of brackets), an integer, or a tuple of slice objects and
 integers.
 Ellipsis and newaxis objects can be interspersed with these as well.
 In order to remain backward compatible with a common usage in Numeric,
 basic slicing is also initiated if the selection object is any sequence
 (such as a list) containing slice objects, the ellipsis
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ellipsis"

\end_inset

 object, or the newaxis
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "newaxis"

\end_inset

 object, but no integer arrays or other embedded sequences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard rules of sequence slicing apply to basic slicing on a per-dimension
 basis (including using a step index).
 Some useful concepts to remember include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The basic slice syntax is '
\begin_inset Formula $i:j:k$
\end_inset

' where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is the starting index, 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is the stopping index, and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the step (
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq0$
\end_inset

).
 This selects the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 elements (in the corresponding dimension) with index values 
\begin_inset Formula $i,\, i+k,\,\ldots,\, i+(m-1)k$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m=q+(r\neq0)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 are the quotient and remainder obtained by dividing 
\begin_inset Formula $j-i$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $j-i=qk+r$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $i+\left(m-1\right)k<j.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of elements in the dimension being sliced.
 Then, if 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is not given it defaults to 0 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is not given it defaults to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is not given it defaults to 1.
 Note that '::' is the same as ':' and means select all indices along this
 axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the number of objects in the selection tuple is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, then ':' is assumed for any remaining dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ellipsis expand to the number of ':' objects needed to make a selection
 tuple of the same length as X.ndim.
 Only one ellipsis is expanded, any others are interpreted as more ':'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each newaxis object in the selection tuple serves to expand the dimensions
 of the resulting selection by one unit-length dimension.
 The added dimension is the position of the newaxis object in the selection
 tuple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, returns the same values as 
\begin_inset Formula $i:i+1$
\end_inset

 
\series bold
except
\series default
 the dimensionality of the returned object is reduced by 1.
 In particular, a selection tuple with the 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 element an integer (and all other entries ':') returns the corresponding
 sub-array with dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1,$
\end_inset

 then the returned object is an Array Scalar.
 These objects are explained in Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Scalar-objects"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the selection tuple has all entries ':' except the 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 entry which is a slice object 
\begin_inset Formula $i:j:k$
\end_inset

, then the returned array has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 formed by concatenating the sub-arrays returned by integer indexing of
 elements 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i+k$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i+(m-1)k<j$
\end_inset

, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Basic slicing with more than one non-':' entry in the slicing tuple, acts
 like repeated application of slicing using a single non-':' entry, where
 the non-':' entries are successively taken (with all other non-':' entries
 replaced by ':').
 Thus, X[ind1,...,ind2,:] acts like X[ind1][...,ind2,:] under basic slicing.
 Note this is NOT true for advanced slicing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may use slicing to set values in the array, but (unlike lists) you can
 never grow the array.
 The size of the value to be set in X[obj] = value must be (broadcastable)
 to the same shape as X[obj].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basic slicing always returns another 
\emph on
view
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ndarray!view"

\end_inset


\emph default
 of the array.
 In other words, the returned array from a basic slicing operation uses
 the same data as the original array.
 This can be confusing at first, but it is faster and can save memory.
 A copy can always be obtained if needed using the unary + operator (which
 has lower precedence than slicing) or the .copy() method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Tip
Remember that a slicing tuple can always be constructed as obj and used
 in the x[obj] notation.
 Slice objects can be used in the construction in place of the [start:stop:step]
 notation.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
x[1:10:5,::-1]
\family default
 can also be implemented as 
\family typewriter
obj=(slice(1,10,5), slice(None,None,-1)); X[obj]
\family default
.
 This can be useful for constructing generic code that works on arrays of
 arbitrary dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Advanced selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advanced selection is triggered when the selection object, obj, is a non-tuple
 sequence object, an ndarray (of data type integer or bool), or a tuple
 with at least one sequence object or ndarray (of data type integer or bool).
 There are two types of advanced indexing: integer and Boolean.
 Advanced selection always returns a copy of the data (contrast with basic
 slicing that returns a view).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integer indexing allows selection of arbitrary items in the array based
 on their 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional index.
 This kind of selection occurs when advanced selection is triggered and
 the selection object is not an array of data type bool.
 For the discussion below, when the selection object is not a tuple, it
 will be referred to as if it had been promoted to a 1-tuple, which will
 be called the selection tuple.
 The rules of advanced integer-style indexing are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if the length of the selection tuple is larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

(=X.ndim) an error is raised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
all sequences and scalars in the selection tuple are converted to intp indexing
 arrays.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
all selection tuple objects must be convertible to intp arrays, or slice
 objects, or the Ellipsis (...) object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exactly one Ellipsis object will be expanded, any other Ellipsis objects
 will be treated as full slice (':') objects.
 The Ellipsis object is replaced with as many full slice (':') objects as
 needed to make the length of the selection tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the selection tuple is smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, then as many ':' objects as needed are added to the end of the selection
 tuple so that the modified selection tuple has length 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The shape of all the integer indexing arrays must be broadcastable to the
 same shape.
 Arrays are broadcastable if any of the following are satisfied 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The arrays all have exactly the same shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The arrays all have the same number of dimensions and the length of each
 dimensions is either a common length or 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The arrays that have too few dimensions can have their shapes pre-pended
 with a dimension of length 1 to satisfy property 2.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The shape of the output (or the needed shape of the object to be used for
 setting) is the broadcasted shape.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Example: If a.shape is (5,1), b.shape is (1,6), c.shape is (6,) and d.shape
 is () so that d is a scalar, then a, b, c, and d are all broadcastable
 to dimension (5,6).
 The array 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acts like a (5,6) array where a[:,0] is broadcast to the other columns,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

b
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acts like a (5,6) array where b[0,:] is broadcast to the other rows, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

c
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acts like a (1,6) array and therefore a (5,6) where c[:] is broadcast to
 every row, and finally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

d
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acts like a (5,6) array where the single values is repeated.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
After expanding any ellipses and filling out any missing (':') objects in
 the selection tuple, then let 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the number of indexing arrays, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}=N-N_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the number of slice objects.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}>0$
\end_inset

 (or we wouldn't be doing advanced integer indexing).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}=0$
\end_inset

 then the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-dimensional result is constructed by varying the index tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i_{1},\ldots,i_{M}\right)$
\end_inset

 over the range of the result shape and for each value of the index tuple
 setting:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{result[$i_{1},\ldots,i_{M}$]=X[ind$_{1}$[$i_{1},\ldots i_{M}$], ind$_{2}$[$i_{1},\ldots,i_{M}$], \, etc.,\, ind$_{N}$[$i_{1},\ldots,i_{M}$]}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Example: Suppose the shape of the broadcasted indexing arrays is 3-dimensional
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is 2.
 Then the result is found by letting 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k$
\end_inset

 run over the shape found by broadcasting 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{ind}_{1},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{ind}_{2},$
\end_inset

and for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k$
\end_inset

 setting result[
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k$
\end_inset

] = X[
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{ind}_{1}[i,j,k]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{ind}_{2}[i,j,k]$
\end_inset

].
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}>0$
\end_inset

, then partial indexing is done.
 This can be somewhat mind-boggling to understand, but if you think in terms
 of the shapes of the arrays involved, it can be easier to grasp what happens.
 In simple cases (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 one indexing array and 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 slice objects) it does exactly what you would expect (concatenation of
 repeated application of basic slicing).
 The rule for partial indexing is that the shape of the result (or the interpret
ed shape of the object to be used in setting) is the shape of X with the
 indexed subspace replaced with the broadcasted indexing subspace.
 If the index subspaces are right next to each other, then the broadcasted
 indexing space directly replaces all of the indexed subspaces in X.
 If the indexing subspaces are separated (by slice objects), then the broadcaste
d indexing space is first, followed by the sliced subspace of X.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Example\InsetSpace ~
1: Suppose X.shape is (10,20,30) and ind is a (2,3,4) indexing intp
 array, then result=X[...,ind,:] has shape (10,2,3,4,30) because the (20,)-shaped
 subspace has been replaced with a (2,3,4)-shaped broadcasted indexing subspace.
 If we let 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k$
\end_inset

 loop over the (2,3,4)-shaped subspace then result[...,i,j,k,:] = X[...,ind[i,j,k],:].
 This example produces the same result as X.take(ind,axis=-2).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example\InsetSpace ~
2: Now let X.shape be (10,20,30,40,50) and suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{ind}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{ind}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are broadcastable to the shape (2,3,4).
 Then X[:,ind
\begin_inset Formula $_{1}$
\end_inset

,ind
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

] has shape (10,2,3,4,40,50) because the (20,30)-shaped subspace from X
 has been replaced with the (2,3,4) subspace from the indices.
 However, X[:,ind
\begin_inset Formula $_{1}$
\end_inset

,:,ind
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

,:] has shape (2,3,4,10,30,50) because there is no unambiguous place to
 drop in the indexing subspace, thus it is tacked-on to the beginning.
 It is always possible to use .transpose() to move the sups pace anywhere
 desired.
 This example cannot be replicated using take.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Boolean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This advanced selection occurs when obj is an array object of Boolean type
 (such as may be returned from comparison operators).
 It is always equivalent to (but faster than) X[obj.nonzero()] where as described
 above obj.nonzero() returns a tuple (of length obj.ndim) of integer index
 arrays showing the True elements of obj.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The special case when obj.ndim == X.ndim is worth mentioning.
 In this case X[obj] returns a 1-dimensional array filled with the elements
 of X corresponding to the True values of obj.
 It The search order will be C-style (last index varies the fastest).
 If obj has True values at entries that are outside of the bounds of X,
 then an index error will be raised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use Boolean arrays as element of the selection tuple.
 In such instances, they will always be interpreted as nonzero(obj) and
 the equivalent integer indexing will be done.
 In general you can think of indexing with Boolean arrays as indexing with
 nonzero(<Boolean>).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
the definition of advanced selection means that X[(1,2,3),] is fundamentally
 different than X[(1,2,3)].
 The latter is equivalent to X[1,2,3] which will trigger basic selection
 while the former will trigger advanced selection.
 Be sure to understand why this is True.
 You should also recognize that x[[1,2,3]] will trigger advanced selection,
 but X[[1,2,slice(None)]] will trigger basic selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Flat Iterator indexing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned previously, X.flat returns an iterator that will iterate over
 the entire array (in C-contiguous style with the last index varying the
 fastest).
 This iterator object can also be indexed using basic slicing or advanced
 indexing as long as the selection object is not a tuple.
 This should be clear from the fact that X.flat is a 1-dimensional view.
 X.flat can be used for integer indexing using 1-dimensional C-style-flat
 indices.
 The shape of any returned array is therefore the shape of the integer indexing

asanyarray
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "asanyarray"

\end_inset

 (object, dtype=None, order=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Thin wrapper around array(...) with subok=1.
 You should use this routine if you are only making use of the array attributes,
 and believe the calculations that will follow would work with any subclass
 of the array.
 Use of this routine increases the chance that array subclasses will interact
 seamlessly with your function --- returning the same subclasses.

\begin_layout Description
require
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "require"

\end_inset

 (object, dtype=None, requirements=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Require a Python object to be an ndarray (or a sub-class) of the given
 data-type if it can be cast safely, otherwise raise an error.
 The requirements, if given, are a sequence containing the requested combination
 of the flags 'C_CONTIGUOUS' ('C'), 'F_CONTIGUOUS' ('F'), 'ALIGNED' ('A'),
 'WRITEABLE' ('W'), 'OWNDATA' ('O'), and the special directive 'ENSUREARRAY'
 ('E').
 These strings dictate which flags should be set on the return array (note
 only one of 'F_CONTIGUOUS' or 'C_CONTIGUOUS' should be used and 'F_CONTIGUOUS'
 over-rides 'C_CONTIGUOUS').
 The special directive 'ENSUREARRAY' makes sure that a base-class ndarray
 is returned instead of allowing sub-classes to pass through.
 This function is particularly useful in a Python interface to C-code (say
 called using ctypes
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ctypes"

\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Description
arange
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "arange"

\end_inset

 (start=, stop=None, step=1, dtype=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Function similar to Python's built-in range() function except it returns
 an ndarray object.
 Return a 1-d array of data type, dtype (or determined from the start, stop,
 and step objects if None), that starts at start, ends 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 stop and is incremented by step.
 The returned array has length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula \[
n=\left\lceil \frac{\textrm{stop}-\textrm{start}}{\textrm{step}}\right\rceil \]

\end_inset

 with element 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{start}+i\cdot\textrm{step}.$
\end_inset

 If stop is None, then the first argument is interpreted as stop and start
 is 0.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
By definition of the ceiling function (denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil x\right\rceil $
\end_inset

), we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leq\left\lceil x\right\rceil <x+1$
\end_inset

, therefore this definition of the length of arange guarantees that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{start}+n\cdot\textrm{step}\geq\textrm{stop}$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{start}+(n-1)\cdot\textrm{step}<\textrm{stop}$

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If sep is '', then return a new 1-d array with data-type descriptor given
 by dtype and with memory initialized (copied) from the raw binary data
 in string.
 If count is non-negative, the new array will have count elements (with
 a 
\family typewriter
ValueError
\family default
 raised if count requires more data than the string offers), otherwise the
 size of the string must be a multiple of the itemsize implied by dtype,
 and count will be the length of the string divided by the itemsize.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 If sep is not '', then interpret the string in ASCII mode with the provided
 separator and convert the string to an array of numbers.
 Any additional white-space will be ignored.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return a 1-d array of data type, dtype, from a file (open file object or
 string with the name of a file to read).
 The file will be read in binary mode if sep is the empty string.
 Otherwise, the file will be read in text mode with sep providing the separator
 string between the entries.
 If count is -1, then the size will be determined from the file, otherwise,
 up to count items will be read from the file.
 If fewer than count items are read, then a RunTimeWarning is issued indicating
 the number of items read.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
frombuffer
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Very similar to (binary-mode) fromstring in interpretation of the arguments,
 except buffer can be any object exposing the buffer interface (or any object
 with a __buffer__ attribute that returns a buffer exposing the buffer protocol).
 The new array shares memory with the buffer object.
 The new array will be read-only if the buffer does not expose a writeable
 buffer.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
load
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "load"

\end_inset

 (file)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Load a NumPy binary file (.npy), a NumPy binary zipfile (.npz), or a pickled
 Python object from an open file.
 If file is a string, then open a file with that name first.
 Which kind of file should be loaded is determined by the magic bytes at
 the front of the file (not by filename extension).
 See 
\shape italic
save
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
savez
\shape default
 for functions which write .npy and .npz files from NumPy arrays.
 If file is a binary zipfile, then an instance of NpzObj is returned.
 This object is a simple wrapper around the zip-file which allows extraction
 of the arrays stored within it.
 The .files attribute of the NpzObj returns a list of all arrays in the archive.
 These arrays are accessible through a dictionary-like interface (obj['name'])
 or through attribute lookup through the .f attribute of the returned object
 (obj.f.name).
 If the file is a NumPy binary file (.npy), then the array itself is returned
 from this function.
 If the file contains a pickled object, then that object is returned.

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Save the array into a file which can be a string or an open file-like object.
 If the file is given as a string, then it will have .npy appended if it

 Save a sequence of arrays into a NumPy binary zipfile (.npz).
 An .npz file is a regular zip-file containing multiple .npy files.
 If keywords are given, then the keyword names are used as filenames (with
 the .npy extension added) in the zip-file with the corresponding values
 being converted to arrays and stored in the specified filename.
 Any non-keyword arguments that are passed in results in the names arr_0,
 arr_1, etc.

\InsetSpace ~
 Construct an array from a function called on a tuple of index grids.
 The function should be able to take array arguments and process them like
 ufuncs (use vectorize if it doesn't).
 The function should accept as many arguments as there are dimensions which
 is a sequence of numbers indicating the length of the desired output for
 each axis.
 Keyword arguments to function may also be passed in as keywords to fromfunction.

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
        self.flat[n] = 
\series bold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The values array is repeated if it is too short.
 In particular, this means that indexing on the values array is modular
 it's length, which might be surprising you are expecting putmask to work
 the same as arr[mask]=values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
lexsort
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "lexsort"

\end_inset

 (keys=, axis=-1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return an array of indices similar to argsort except sorting is done using
 all of the provided keys.
 First a sort is computed using key[0], then the indices are further altered
 by sorting on key[1].
 This is repeated until sorting has been performed on all of the keys.
 This is a useful function for multiple-field sorting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = [1,2,1,3,1,5]; b = [0,4,5,6,2,3]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Notice the order the keys had to be used in order to get a lexicographical
 sorting order.
 To clarify, suppose three equal-length sequences are fields of an underlying
 data-type: (f1,f2,f3).
 If we want to sort first on f1 and then on f2 and then on f3, the indices
 that would accomplish that sort are obtained as lexsort((f3,f2,f1)).

\begin_layout Description
correlate
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Compute the 1-d cross correlation of x and y keeping portions determined
 by mode which may be 'valid' (0), 'same' (1), or 'full' (2).
 The 'full' cross-correlation between two 1-d arrays is computed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z\left[n\right]=\sum_{i=\max\left(n-M,0\right)}^{\min\left(n,K\right)}x\left[i\right]y\left[n+i\right],\]

for

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

=len(
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

)-1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

=len(
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

)-1, and we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $K\geq M$
\end_inset

 (without loss of generality because we can interchange the roles of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 without effect).
 For this formula to work, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $x[i]=0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $i\notin\left[0,K-1\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y[j]=0$

\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 middle values are returned starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\left\lfloor \frac{M-1}{2}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 If the flag has a value of 'valid' then only the middle 
\begin_inset Formula $K-M+1=\left(K+1\right)-\left(M+1\right)+1$
\end_inset

 output values are returned starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $n=M.$

 Convolution is very similar to correlation except it is defined with one
 sequence reversed: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z\left[n\right]=\sum_{i}x[i]y[n-i].\]

\end_inset

 The mode keyword has the same effect as it does for correlation.
 Convolution ('full') between two 1-d arrays implements polynomial multiplicatio
n where the array entries are viewed as coefficients for polynomials.

\end_inset

 This can be determined by using the code

 Computes the inner product between two arrays.
 This is an array that has shape a.shape[:-1] + b.shape[:-1] with elements

 The product-sum is over the last dimension of

\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 Specifically, if 
\begin_inset Formula $I$

\end_inset

 are super indices for

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Computes a dot-product between two arrays where the sum is taken over the
 axes specified by the 2-sequence which can have either scalar or sequence
 entries.
 The axes specified are summed over and the remaining axes are used to construct
 the result.
 So, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times4\times5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times3\times2$
\end_inset

 then if axes=([1,0],[0,1]) (or axes=([0,1],[1,0])) the result will be 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times2$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 represent the indices of the un-summed axes in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 represent the indices of the un-summed axes in 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

\end_inset

 represent the the indices of the axes summed over in both 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 Also, let 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}$

 where the axes to be summed over are pushed to the end, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{t}$
\end_inset

 represent a transposed version of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 where the axes to be summed over are pushed to the front.
 Then, using

 Returns the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.
 The cross product is performed over the axes of the input arrays indicated
 by the axisa, and axisb arguments.
 For both arrays, the axis used must have dimension either 2 or 3.
 If both axes used have dimension 2, then only the z-component of the equivalent
 3-d cross product is returned.
 Otherwise, the entire vector is returned.
 The axisc argument gives the axis of the vectors in the returned cross-product
 result.

\begin_layout Section
Functions redundant with methods 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several functions are available primarily for purposes of backward compatibility
 with old Numeric, and are therefore redundant.
 The functions are all simple wrappers for asarray(a).<function>(*args, **kwds),
 or are replaceable by attribute access.
 The following list documents them.
 It is not recommended that these functions be used in new programs, but
 there are no plans for removing them as in functional form they work with
 arbitrary sequences which is sometimes desirable.
 The functions that mirror methods and attributes are:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~

 alias for an array type object.
 If no suitable data type object can be determined, return default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
sctype2char (sctype)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return the typecode character associated with an array-scalar type dtype.
 The first argument is first converted to a dtype if it needs to be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Tip
the type attribute of data-type objects are actual Python type objects subclasse
d in a hierarchy of types.
 This can often be useful to check data types generically.
 For example, issubclass(dtype.type, integer) can check to see if the data
 type is one of the 10 different integer types.
 The issubclass function, however, raises an error if either argument is
 not an actual type object.
 NumPy defines _(arg1, arg2) that will return false instead of raise an
 error.
 Alternatively, dtype.kind is a character describing the class of the data-type
 so dtype.kind in 'iu' would also check to see if the data-type is an integer
 type.

average
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

 (a, axis=None, weights=None, returned=0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Computes the average along the indicated axis.
 If axis is None, average over the entire array.
 Inputs can be integer or floating types; result is type float.
 If weights are given, the result is sum(a*weights)/sum(weights).
 Therefore, weights must have shape equal to a.shape or be 1-d with length
 a.shape[axis].
 Integer weights are converted to float.
 If returned is True, then return a tuple showing both the result and the
 sum of the weights (or count of the values).
 The shape of these two results will be the same.

\begin_layout Description
cov
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "cov"

\end_inset

 (x, y=None, rowvar=1, bias=0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Compute the covariance matrix of data in x.
 If x is a vector and y is None, then this function is equivalent to asarray(x).v
ar().
 Otherwise, x is interpreted as observations of several random variables.
 If rowvar is True (default), then the variables are in the rows and the
 observations of the variables are in the columns.
 Otherwise, the variables are in the columns and the observations are in
 the rows.
 If y is given then it is treated as another variable or set of variables
 to be added to x.
 By default, a so-called unbiased estimate of the covariance matrix is made.
 If bias is non-zero, then a biased normalization factor (with better mean-squar
e error performance) is used instead.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 is a random vector, then the covariance matrix is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{C}=E\left[\left(\mathbf{X}-E\mathbf{X}\right)\left(\mathbf{X}-E\mathbf{X}\right)^{H}\right].\]

\end_inset

 It can be approximated as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{C}\approx\frac{1}{P}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{x}}\right)\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{x}}\right)^{H}\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 (as a column-vector), 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of observations made and 
\begin_inset Formula $P=N-1$
\end_inset

 for an unbiased estimate or 
\begin_inset Formula $P=N$

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Estimate the correlation coefficient of x.
 By default, each row of x contains a random variable with observations
 of the random variable in the columns of x.
 (If rowvar is False, the each column is a random variable with observations
 in the rows).
 The y argument can be used to append additional variables to x.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 row and 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 column of the correlation coefficient matrix is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}$

 (x=, bins=None, range=None, normed=0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Construct a histogram for the data in x (treated as one-dimensional array
 of type float).
 If bins is not a sequence, then bins should be the number of bins which
 will be constructed ranging from range[0] to range[1] or x.min() to x.max()
 if range is None.
 If normed is True, then the histogram will be normalized and comparable
 with a probability density function, otherwise it will be a count of the
 number of items in each bin.
 The return value is the tuple (n, bins) where n is the histogram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
histogram2d
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

 (x, y, bins=10, range=None, normed=False)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Compute the two-dimensional histogram for a dataset (x,y) given the bins.
 Returns (histogram, xedges, yedges).
 The bins argument can be either the number of bins or a sequence of the
 bin edges if the x and y directions should have the same bins.
 If the bins argument is a sequence of length 2, then separate bin edges
 will be computed.
 The first element can be either the number of bins or the bin edges for
 the x-direction.
 The second element is interpreted as the number of bins or the bin edges
 for the y-direction.
 The returned histogram array, H, is a count of the number of samples in
 each bin.
 The array is oriented such that H[i,j] is the number of samples falling
 into binx[j] and biny[i] (notice the association x<->j and y<->i).
 Setting normed to True returns a density rather than a bin-count.
 The range argument allows specifying lower and upper bin edges (in a sequence
 of length 2 with 2-length sequences in each entry).
 The default is [[x.min(), x.max()],[y.min(), y.max()]].

 arrays or an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times D$
\end_inset

 array where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of samples and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the number of dimensions.
 Returns (histogram, edges) where histogram is a 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional array of shape given by the number of bins selected in each
 axis containing the number of counts that a point in the sample data fell
 into the volume bin specified.
 The edges sequence has 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-entries to specify the edge boundaries for each dimension.
 The bins argument is a sequence of edge arrays or a sequence of the number
 of bins.
 If a scalar is given, it is assumed to be the number of bins for all dimensions.
 The range is a length-
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 sequence containing lower and upper bin edges which default to the min
 and maximum of the respective datasets.
 If normed is True, then a density rather than a bin-count is returned.

 Returns an array comprised from different elements of choicelist depending
 on the list of conditions.
 The condlist argument is a list of Boolean condition arrays.
 The choicelist argument is a list of choice arrays (of the same size as
 the arrays in condlist).
 The result has the same size as the arrays in choicelist.
 If condlist is [
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},\ldots,c_{N-1}$

.
 The elements of choicelist can then be represented as [
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0},\ldots,v_{N-1}$
\end_inset

].
 The default choice if none of the conditions are met is given as the default
 argument.
 The conditions are tested in order and the first one satisfied is used
 to select the choice.
 In other words, the elements of the output array are found from the following

\end_inset

 (x, condlist, funclist, *args, **kw)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Compute a piecewise-defined function.
 A piecewise defined function is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(x\right)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
f_{1}\left(x\right) & x\in S_{1},\\
f_{2}\left(x\right) & x\in S_{2},\\
\vdots & \vdots\\
f_{n}\left(x\right) & x\in S_{n}.\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 are sets.
 Thus, the function is defined differently over different sub-domains of
 the input.
 Such a function can be computed using 
\family typewriter
select
\family default
 but such an implementation means calling each 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 over the entire region of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset

 The piecewise call guarantees that each function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 will only be called over those values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Arguments: x is the array of values over which to call the function; condlist
 is a sequence of Boolean (indicator) arrays (or a single Boolean array)
 of the same shape as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 that defines the sets (True indicates that element of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is in the set).
 If needed, to match the length of funclist, an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

otherwise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 set will be added to condlist.
 This otherwise set is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}=\overline{\bigcup S_{i}}.$
\end_inset

 The argument funclist is a list of functions to be called (or items to
 be inserted) corresponding to the conditions.
 Each of these functions can take extra arguments and key-word arguments
 which are passed in as *args, and **kw using standard Python syntax.
 Each of these functions should return vector output for vector input.
 If the function is a scalar, then it will simply be inserted where appropriate
 into the output.
 It is the equivalent of a constant function.

 then trapz can be used to approximate the integral of the function using
 the trapezoidal rule.
 If the sampling is not evenly spaced use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

 to pass in the sample positions.
 Otherwise, only the sample-spacing is needed in dx.
 The trapz function can work with many functions at a time stored in an

 Pack an integer array of logical data (zero/non-zero) into bits of a uint8
 data-type along the dimension given by axis.
 This dimension is shrunk by a factor of 8 (rounded up).
 Each element in the input is converted to a bit in the output which is
 set to 1 or 0 depending on whether the input is non-zero or not.
 Thus, every 8-element chunk of the input is converted to a single byte
 in the output.
 If axis is None, then the bit-packing is done on the entire array as if

 Thus, both place and obj should be strings.
 If doc is a string, then a single docstring is added to obj from place.
 If doc is a 2-tuple, then obj must be an object with attributes that need
 to be commented.
 The first element of the doc tuple is the attribute to be commented on
 and the second element is the actual docstring.
 If doc is a list, then it must be composed of elements that are 2-tuples
 indicating that obj has several attributes that need to be documented.

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This indexing cross function is useful for forming indexing arrays necessary
 to select out the cross-product of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 1-dimensional arrays.
 Note that the default indexing does not do a cross-product (which might
 be unexpected for someone coming from other programming environments).
 The default indexing is more general purpose.
 Using the ix_ constructor can produce the indexing arrays necessary to
 select a cross-product.

 The broadcasting rules will ensure that any universal function operating
 on the grid will act as if the ogrid had been the result of mgrid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
r_
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "r\\_"

\end_inset

 [index expression]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This is a simple way to build up arrays quickly.
 There are two use cases.
 1) If the index expression contains comma separated arrays, then stack
 them along their first axis.
 2) If the index expression contains slice notation or scalars then create
 a 1-d array with a range indicated by the slice notation.
 In other-words the slice syntax start:stop:step is equivalent to arange(start,
 stop, step) inside of the brackets.
 However, if step is an imaginary number (i.e.
 100j) then its integer portion is interpreted as a number-of-points desired
 and the start and stop are inclusive.
 In other words start:stop:step
\family typewriter
j
\family default
 is interpreted as linspace(start, stop, step, endpoint=1) inside of the
 brackets.
 After expansion of slice notation, all comma separated sequences are concatenat
ed together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Optional character strings placed as the first element of the index expression
 can be used to change the output.
 The strings 'r' or 'c' result in matrix output.
 If the result is 1-d and 'r' is specified a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times N$
\end_inset

 (row) matrix is produced.
 If the result is 1-d and 'c' is specified, then a 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times1$
\end_inset

 (column) matrix is produced.
 If the result is 2-d then both provide the same matrix result.

\newline
array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 A string with three comma-separated integers allows specification of the
 axis to concatenate along, the minimum number of dimensions to force the
 entries to, and which axis should contain the start of the arrays which
 are less than the specified number of dimensions.
 In other words the third integer allows you to specify where the the 1's
 should be placed in the shape of the arrays that have their shapes upgraded.
 By default, they are placed in the front of the shape tuple.
 The third argument allows you to specify where the start of the array should
 be instead.
 Thus, a third argument of '0' would place the 1's at the end of the array
 shape.
 Negative integers specify where in the new shape tuple the last dimension
 of upgraded arrays should be placed, so the default is '-1'.

 When one type is cast to another in this fashion, a very low-level operation
 takes place.
 Typically, you get what your C-compiler produces for the cast, but notice
 that in the case of casting to a bool type, the value becomes either a
 0 or a 1.

 All of the windowing functions are smoothing windows that attempt to balance

 A rectangular window has the smallest main-lobe width but the largest side-lobe
 height.
 A windowing (tapering) function tries to can help trade off main-lobe width
 By sacrificing a little in resolution using a windowing function These
 windows can be used to smooth data using the convolve function.

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The trade-off between main-lobe and side-lobe has been studied extensively.
 Solutions that maximize energy in the main-lobe compared to energy in the
 side-lobes can be found by finding an eigenvector which can be expensive
 to compute for large window sizes.
 A good approximation to these prolate-spheroidal windows is the Kaiser
 window.

\end_inset

-point Kaiser smoothing window.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 parameter controls the width of the window (and the frequency-domain side-lobe
 height and main-lobe width).
 The window is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
w\left[n\right]=\frac{1}{I_{0}\left(\beta\right)}I_{0}\left(\beta\sqrt{1-\frac{\left(2n-M-1\right)^{2}}{\left(M-1\right)^{2}}}\right).\]

\end_inset

 There is an empirical relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and the side-lobe height which can be used in FIR filter design.
 To achieve a side-lobe height of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\alpha$
\end_inset

dB, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 parameter is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
0.1002\left(\alpha-8.7\right) & \alpha>50,\\
0.5842\left(\alpha-21\right)^{0.4}+0.07886\left(\alpha-21\right) & 21\leq\alpha\leq50,\\
0 & \alpha<21.\end{array}\right.\]

 Five (or six) of these new scalar objects are essentially equivalent to
 fundamental Python types and therefore inherit from them as well as from
 the generic array scalar type.
 The bool_ data type is very similar to the Python BooleanType but does
 not inherit from it because Python's BooleanType does not allow itself
 to be inherited from, and on the C-level the size of the actual bool_ data
 is not the same as a Python Boolean scalar.

\begin_layout Standard
The array scalars have the same attributes and methods as arrays and live
 in a hierarchy of scalar types so they can be easily classified based on
 their type objects.
 However, because array scalars are immutable, and attributes change intrinsic
 properties of the object, the 
\series bold
array scalar attributes are not settable
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Array scalars can be detected using the hierarchy of data types.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
isinstance(val, generic)
\family default
 will return True if val is an array scalar object.
 Alternatively, what kind of array scalar is present can be determined using
 other members of the data type hierarchy.
 Thus, for example 
\family typewriter
isinstance(val, complexfloating)
\family default
 will return True if val is a complex valued type, while 
\family typewriter
isinstance(val, flexible)
\family default
 will return true if val is one of the flexible itemsize array types (string,
 unicode, void).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
The bool_ type is not a subclass of the int_ type (the bool_ type is not
 even a number type).
 This is different than Python's default implementation of bool as a sub-class
 of int.

\begin_layout Section
Methods of array scalars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Array scalars have exactly the same methods as arrays.
 The default behavior of these methods is to internally convert the scalar
 to an equivalent 0-dimensional array and to call the corresponding array
 method.
 The exceptions to these rules are given below.
 In addition, math operations on array scalars are defined so that the same
 hardware flags are set and used to interpret the results as for ufunc.
 Therefore the error state used for ufuncs also carries over to the math
 on array scalars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
__new__ (obj)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The default behavior is to return a new array or array scalar by calling
 array(obj) with the corresponding data type.
 There are two situations when this default behavior is delayed until another
 approach is tried.
 First, when the array scalar type inherits from a Python type, then the
 Python types new method is called first and the default method is called
 only if that approach fails.
 The second situation is for the 
\family typewriter
void
\family default
 data type where a single integer-like argument will cause a void scalar
 of that size to be created and initialized to 0.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Notice that because array(obj) is called for new, if obj is a nested sequence,
 then the return object could actually be an

 Thus, arrays of the correct type can also be created by calling the array
 data type name directly:

\begin_layout Section
Defining New Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to effectively define a new type of array.
 One way is to simply subclass the ndarray and overwrite the methods of
 interest.
 This will work to a degree, but internally certain behaviors are fixed
 by the data type of the array.
 To fully customize the data type of an array you need to define a new data-type
 for the array, and register it with NumPy.
 This new type can only be defined in C.
 How to define a new data type in C will be discussed in the next part of
 the book.

\end_inset

 It is true that an array-scalar can be interpreted as a data-type object
 and so can be used to refer to the data-type of an array.
 However, the data-type object is a separate Python object.
 Every ndarray has an associated data-type object that completely defines
 the data in the array (including any named fields).
 For every built-in data-type object there is an associated type object
 whose instances are the array-scalars.
 Because of the association between each data-type object and a type-object
 of the corresponding array scalar, the array-scalar type-objects can also
 be thought of as data-types.
 However, for the type objects of flexible array-scalars (string, unicode_,
 and void), the type-objects alone are not enough to specify the full data-type
 because the length is not given.
 The data-type constructor, 
\series bold
numpy.dtype
\series default
, converts any object that can be considered as a data-type into a data-type
 object which is the actual object an ndarray looks to in order to interpret
 each element of its data region.
 Whenever a data-type is required in a NumPy function or method, supplying
 a dtype object is always fastest.
 If the object supplied is not a dtype object, then it will be converted
 to one using dtype(obj).
 Therefore, understanding data-type objects is the key to understanding
 how data types are really represented and understood in NumPy.

\begin_layout Description
fields
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_inset

 A dictionary showing any named fields that have been defined for this data-type
 (or None if there are no named fields).
 Fields can be assigned to any built-in data-type (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 using the tuple input to the dtype constructor).
 However, fields are most useful for (subtypes of) void data-types which
 can be any size.
 Fields are a convenient way to keep track of fixed-size sub-parts of the
 total fixed-size array-element, or record.
 A field is defined in terms of another dtype object and an offset (in bytes)
 into the current record.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The fields dictionary is indexed by keys that are the names of the fields.
 Each entry in the dictionary is a tuple fully describing the field: (dtype,
 offset[, title]).
 If present, the optional title can actually be any object (if it is string
 or unicode then it will also be a key in the fields dictionary, otherwise
 it's meta-data).
 Notice also, that the first two elements of the tuple can be passed directly
 as arguments to the getfield and setfield attributes of an ndarray.
 If field names are not specified in a constructor, they default to 'f0',
 'f2', ..., 'f<n-1>'.

 Numarray introduced the concept of a fixed-length record having fields
 that were themselves arrays of another data-type.
 This is supported at a fundamental level in NumPy using this attribute
 which maintains the simplicity of defining a field by another data-type
 object.
 It either returns None or a tuple (base dtype, shape) where shape is a
 tuple showing the size of the C-contiguous array and the base dtype object
 indicates the data-type in each element of the subarray.
 If a field whose dtype object has this attribute is retrieved, then the
 extra dimensions implied by the shape are tacked on to the end of the retrieved
 array.

 A basic format in this context is an optional shape specifier followed

 Parenthesis are required on the shape if it is greater than 1-d.
 NumPy allows a modification on the format in that any string that can uniquely
 identify the type can be used to specify the data-type in a field.
 This data-type defines fields named 'f0', 'f2', ..., 'f<N-1>' where N (>1)
 is the number of comma-separated basic formats in the string.
 If the optional shape specifier is provided, then the data-type for the
 corresponding field contains a subdtype attribute providing the shape.

names and formats: This style has two required and two optional keys.
 The 'names' and 'formats' keys are required.
 Their respective values are equal-length lists with the field names and
 the field formats.
 The field names must be strings and the field formats can be any object
 accepted by dtypedescr constructor.
 The optional keys in the dictionary are 'offsets' and 'titles' and their
 values must each be lists of the same length as the 'names' and 'formats'
 lists.
 The 'offsets' value is a list of integer offsets for each field, while
 the 'titles' value is a list of titles for each field (None can be used
 if no title is desired for that field).
 The titles can be any string or unicode object and will add another entry

 The state is an 8-tuple with (version, endian, self.subdtype, self.names,
 self.fields, self.itemsize, self.alignment, self.flags).
 The self.itemsize and self.alignment entries are both -1 if the data-type

The ndarray in NumPy is a

new-style

\end_inset

 Python built-in-type.
 Therefore, it can be inherited from (in Python or in C) if desired.
 Therefore, it can form a foundation for many useful classes.
 Often whether to sub-class the array object or to simply use the core array
 component as an internal part of a new class is a difficult decision, and
 can be simply a matter of choice.
 NumPy has several tools for simplifying how your new object interacts with
 other array objects, and so the choice may not be significant in the end.
 One way to simplify the question is by asking yourself if the object you
 are interested can be replaced as a single array or does it really require
 two or more arrays at it's core.
 For example, in the standard NumPy distribution, the matrix and records
 classes inherit from the ndarray, while masked arrays use two ndarrays
 as objects of its internal structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that asarray(a) always returns the base-class ndarray.
 If you are confident that your use of the array object can handle any subclass
 of an ndarray, then asanyarray(a) can be used to allow subclasses to propagate
 more cleanly through your subroutine.
 In principal a subclass could redefine any aspect of the array and therefore,
 under strict guidelines, asanyarray(a) would rarely be useful.
 However, most subclasses of the arrayobject will not redefine certain aspects
 of the array object such as the buffer interface, or the attributes of
 the array.
 One of important example, however, of why your subroutine may not be able
 to handle an arbitrary subclass of an array is that matrices redefine the
 '*' operator to be matrix-multiplication, rather than element-by-element
 multiplication.

Matrix Objects

\end_inset

Matrix objects inherit from the ndarray and therefore, they have the same
 attributes and methods of ndarrays.
 There are six important differences of matrix objects, however that may
 lead to unexpected results when you use matrices but expect them to act
 like arrays:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Matrix objects can be created using a string notation to allow Matlab-style
 syntax where spaces separate columns and semicolons (';') separate rows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Matrix objects are always two-dimensional.
 This has far-reaching implications, in that m.ravel() is still two-dimensional
 (with a 1 in the first dimension) and item selection returns two-dimensional
 objects so that sequence behavior is fundamentally different than arrays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Matrix objects over-ride multiplication to be matrix-multiplication.
 
\series bold
Make sure you understand this for functions that you may want to receive
 matrices.
 Especially in light of the fact that asanyarray(m) returns a matrix when
 m is a matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Matrix objects over-ride power to be matrix raised to a power.
 The same warning about using power inside a function that uses asanyarray(...)
 to get an array object holds for this fact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The default __array_priority__ of matrix objects is 10.0, and therefore mixed
 operations with ndarrays always produce matrices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Matrices have special attributes which make calculations easier.
 These are

\begin_layout Enumerate
.A --- return a view of the data of self as a 2d array (no copy is done).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Warning
Matrix objects over-ride multiplication, '*', and power, '**', to be matrix-mult
iplication and matrix power, respectively.
 If your subroutine can accept sub-classes and you do not convert to base-class
 arrays, then you must use the ufuncs multiply and power to be sure that
 you are performing the correct operation for all inputs.

Memory-mapped files are useful for reading and/or modifying small segments
 of a large file with regular layout, without reading the entire file into
 memory.
 A simple subclass of the ndarray uses a memory-mapped file for the data
 buffer of the array.
 For small files, the over-head of reading the entire file into memory is
 typically not significant, however for large files using memory mapping
 can save considerable resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
Memory-mapped arrays use the the Python memory-map object which (prior to
 Python 2.5) does not allow files to be larger than a certain size depending
 on the platform.
 This size is always < 2GB even on 64-bit systems.

These are enhanced arrays of either string type or unicode_ type.
 These arrays inherit from the ndarray, but specially-define the operations
 +, *, and % on a (broadcasting) element-by-element basis.
 These operations are not available on the standard ndarray of character
 type.
 In addition, the chararray has all of the standard string (and unicode)
 methods, executing them on an element-by-element basis.
 Perhaps the easiest way to create a chararray is to use self.view(chararray)
 where self is an ndarray of string or unicode data-type.
 However, a chararray can also be created using the numpy.chararray.__new__
 method.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Create a new character array of string or unicode type and itemsize characters.
 Create the array using buffer (with offset and strides) if it is not None.
 If buffer is None, then construct a new array with strides in Fortran order

Record Arrays (numpy.rec)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "record arrays|("

\end_inset

NumPy provides a powerful data-type object that allows any ndarray to hold
 (arbitrarily nested) record-like items with named-field access to the sub-types.
 This is possible without any special record-array sub-class.
 Consider the example where each item in the array is a simple record of
 name, age, and weight.
 You could specify a data-type for an array of such records using the following
 data-type object:
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> desc = dtype({'names': ['name', 'age', 'weight'], 'formats': ['S30',
 'i2', 'f4']})
\newline
>>> a = array([('Bill',31,260.0),('Fred', 15, 145.0)],dtype=desc)
\newline
>>>
 print a[0]
\newline
('Bill', 31, 260.0)
\newline
>>> print a['name']
\newline
['Bill' 'Fred']
\newline
>>> print
 a['age']
\newline
[31 15]
\newline
>>> print a['weight']
\newline
[ 260.
  145.]
\newline
>>> print a[0]['name'], a[0]['age'], a[0]['weight']
\newline
Bill 31 260.0
\newline
>>>
 print len(a[0])
\newline
3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example shows how a general array can be assigned named fields and
 how these fields can be accessed.
 In this case the a[0] object is an array-scalar of type void.
 The void array-scalars are unique in that they contain references to (rather
 than copies of) the underlying data whenever fields are defined.
 Therefore, the record data can be modified in place:
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a[0]['name'] = 'George'; print a
\newline
[('George', 31, 260.0) ('Fred', 15, 145.0)]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recarray subclass and its accompanying record item add the ability to
 access named fields through attribute lookup.
 A quick way to get a record array is to use the view method of the ndarray.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> r = a.view(recarray)
\newline
>>> print r.name
\newline
['George' 'Fred']
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numpy.core.records module (aliased to nump.rec when numpy is imported)
 contains additional convenience functions for constructing record arrays.
 All of the following constructors have two different mechanisms for specifying
 the data-type.
 Either the dtype= argument can be specified or the argument formats= can
 be specified along with an optional set of four additional keyword arguments
 (names=, titles=, aligned= and byteorder=).
 In some cases neither dtype= nor formats= is required as the data-type
 can be inferred from the object passed in as the first argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five argument method for specifying a data-type constructs a data-type
 object internally.
 The comma-separated formats string is used to specify the fields.
 The names (and optional titles) of the fields can be specified by a comma-separ
ated string of names (or titles).
 The aligned flag determines whether the fields are packed (False) or padded
 (True) according to the platform compiler rules.
 The byteorder argument allows specification of the byte-order for all of
 the fields at once (they can also be specified individually in the formats
 string).
 The default byte-order is native to the platform.

Masked Arrays (numpy.ma)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_inset

These are adapted from the masked arrays provided with Numeric.
 Masked Arrays do not inherit from the ndarray, they simply use two ndarray
 objects in their internal representation.
 Fortunately, as I have not used masked arrays in my work, Paul Dubois (the
 original author of MA for Numeric) adapted and modified the code for use
 by NumPy.
 Alexander Belopolsky (Sasha) added additional functions and improvements

data Something that can be converted to an array.
 If data is already a masked array, then if mask is ma.nomask, the mask used
 be data.mask and the data used data.data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dtype The data-type of the underlying array
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
copy If copy is False, then every effort will be made to not copy the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
order Specify whether the array is in 'C', 'Fortran', or 'Any' order 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
mask Masked values are excluded from calculations.
 If this is ma.nomask, then there are no masked values.
 Otherwise, this should be an object that is convertible to an array of
 Booleans with the same shape as data.

\begin_layout Description
fill_value This value is used to fill in masked values when necessary.
 The fill_value is not used for computation for functions within the ma
 module.

 The container class is a Python class whose self.array attribute is an ndarray.
 Multiple inheritance is probably easier with numpy.lib.user_array.container
 than with the ndarray itself and so it is included by default.
 It is not documented here beyond mentioning its existence because you are
 encouraged to use the ndarray class directly if you can.

\begin_layout Section
Array Iterators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "array iterator"

\end_inset

Iterators are a powerful concept for array processing.
 Essentially, iterators implement a generalized for-loop.
 If myiter is an iterator object, then the Python code
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
for val in myiter:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    some code involving val
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
calls val=myiter.next() repeatedly until StopIteration is raised by the iterator.
 There are several ways to iterate over an array that may be useful: default
 iteration, flat iteration, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional enumeration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Default iteration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default iterator of an ndarray object is the default Python iterator
 of a sequence type.
 Thus, when the array object itself is used as an iterator.
 The default behavior is equivalent to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
for i in arr.shape[0]:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    val = arr[i]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This default iterator selects a sub-array of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 from the array.
 This can be a useful construct for defining recursive algorithms.
 To loop over the entire array requires 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 for-loops.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> a = arange(24).reshape(3,2,4)+10
\newline
>>> for val in a:
\newline
...
     print 'item:', val
\newline
item: [[10 11 12 13]
\newline
 [14 15 16 17]]
\newline
item: [[18 19
 20 21]
\newline
 [22 23 24 25]]
\newline
item: [[26 27 28 29]
\newline
 [30 31 32 33]]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Flat iteration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned previously, the flat attribute of ndarray objects returns an
 iterator that will cycle over the entire array in C-style contiguous order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> for i, val in enumerate(a.flat):
\newline
...
     if i%5 == 0: print i, val
\newline
0 10
\newline
5 15
\newline
10 20
\newline
15 25
\newline
20 30
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, I've used the built-in enumerate iterator to return the iterator index
 as well as the value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
N-dimensional enumeration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes it may be useful to get the N-dimensional index while iterating.
 The ndenumerate iterator can achieve this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout MyCode
>>> for i, val in ndenumerate(a):
\newline
...
     if sum(i)%5 == 0: print i, val
\newline
(0, 0, 0) 10
\newline
(1, 1, 3) 25
\newline
(2, 0, 3) 29
\newline

 1, 2) 32

Iterator for broadcasting

The general concept of broadcasting is also available from Python using
 the 
\series bold

\series default
 iterator.
 This object takes 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 objects as inputs and returns an iterator that returns tuples providing
 each of the input sequence elements in the broadcasted result.

\begin_layout MyCode

Universal functions are wrappers that provide a common interface to mathematical
 functions that operate on scalars, and can be made to operate on arrays
 in an element-by-element fashion.
 All

u
\family default
niversal 
\family typewriter
func
\family default
tion
\family typewriter
s
\family default
 (
\family typewriter
ufuncs
\family default
) wrap some core function that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 (scalar) inputs and produces 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{o}$
\end_inset

 (scalar) outputs.
 Typically, this core function is implemented in compiled code but a Python
 function can also be wrapped into a universal function using the basic
 method 
\family typewriter
frompyfunc
\family default
 in the umath module.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
frompyfunc (func, nin, nout)
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "frompyfunc"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This function returns a new universal function wrapping a Python function
 func with nin inputs and nout outputs.
 The resulting universal function works using Object arrays for both input
 and output.
 The vectorize class makes use of frompyfunc internally.
 You can view the source code using numpy.source(numpy.vectorize).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Broadcasting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "broadcasting"

\end_inset

Each universal function takes array inputs and produces array outputs by
 performing the core function element-wise on the inputs.
 The standard broadcasting rules are applied so that inputs without exactly
 the same shapes can still be usefully operated on.
 Broadcasting can be understood by four rules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All input arrays with ndim smaller than the input array of largest ndim
 have 1's pre-pended to their shapes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The size in each dimension of the output shape is the maximum of all the
 input shapes in that dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An input can be used in the calculation if it's shape in a particular dimension
 either matches the output shape or has value exactly 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If an input has a dimension size of 1 in its shape, the first data entry
 in that dimension will be used for all calculations along that dimension.
 In other words, the stepping machinery of the ufunc will simply not step
 along that dimension when otherwise needed (the stride will be 0 for that
 dimension).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While perhaps a bit difficult to explain, broadcasting can be quite useful
 and becomes second nature rather quickly.
 Broadcasting is used throughout NumPy to decide how to handle non equally-shape
d arrays.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Output type determination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output of the ufunc (and its methods) does not have to be an ndarray.
 All output arrays will be passed to the __array_wrap__ method of any input
 (besides ndarrays, and scalars) that defines it 
\series bold
and
\series default
 has the highest __array_priority__ of any other input to the universal
 function.
 The default __array_priority__ of the ndarray is 0.0, and the default __array_pr
iority__ of a subtype is 1.0.
 Matrices have __array_priority__ equal to 10.0.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ufuncs can also all take output arguments.
 The output will be cast if necessary to the provided output array.
 If a class with an __array__ method is used for the output, results will
 be written to the object returned by __array__.
 Then, if the class also has an __array_wrap__ method, the returned 
\family typewriter
ndarray
\family default
 result will be passed to that method just before passing control back to
 the caller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use of internal buffers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internally, buffers are used for misaligned data, swapped data, and data
 that has to be converted from one data type to another.
 The size of the internal buffers is settable on a per-thread basis.
 There can be up to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\left(n_{i}+n_{o}\right)$
\end_inset

 buffers of the specified size created to handle the data from all the inputs
 and outputs of a ufunc.
 The default size of the buffer is 10,000 elements.
 Whenever buffer-based calculation would be needed, but all input arrays
 are smaller than the buffer size, those misbehaved or incorrect typed arrays
 will be copied before the calculation proceeds.
 Adjusting the size of the buffer may therefore alter the speed at which
 ufunc calculations of various sorts are completed.
 A simple interface for setting this variable is accessible using the function
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
setbufsize (size)
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "setbufsize"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Set the buffer size to the given number of elements in the current thread.
 Return the old buffer size (so that it can be reset later if desired).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "error handling"

\end_inset

Universal functions can trip special floating point status registers in
 your hardware (such as divide-by-zero).
 If available on your platform, these registers will be regularly checked
 during calculation.
 The user can determine what should be done if errors are encountered.
 Error handling is controlled on a per-thread basis.
 Four errors can be individually configured: divide-by-zero, overflow, underflow
, and invalid.
 The errors can each be set to ignore, warn, raise, or call.
 The easiest way to configure the error mask is using the function 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
seterr (all=None, divide=None, over=None, under=None, invalid=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "seterr"

\end_inset

This will set the current thread so that errors can be handled if desired.
 If one of the errors is set to 'call', then a function must be provided
 using the seterrcall() routine.
 If any of the arguments are None, then that error mask will be unchanged.
 The return value of this function is a dictionary with the old error conditions.
 Thus, you can restore the old condition after you are finished with your
 function by calling seterr(**old).
 If all is set, then all errors will be set to the specified value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
seterrcall (callable)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "seterrcall"

\end_inset

This sets the function to call when an error is triggered for an error condition
 configured with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

call
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 handler.
 This function should take two arguments: a string showing the type of error
 that triggered the call, and an integer showing the state of the floating
 point status registers.
 Any return value of the call function will be ignored, but errors can be
 raised by the function.
 Only one error function handler can be specified for all the errors.
 The status argument shows which errors were raised.
 The return value of this routine is the old callable.
 The argument passed in to this function must be any callable object with
 the right signature or None.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
FPE_DIVIDEBYZERO, FPE_OVERFLOW, FPE_UNDERFLOW, and FPE_INVALID, are all
 defined constants in NumPy.
 The status flag returned for a 'call' error handling type shows which errors
 were raised by adding these constants together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Optional keyword arguments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ufunc!keyword arguments"

\end_inset

All ufuncs take optional keyword arguments.
 These represent rather advanced usage and will likely not be used by most
 users.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
sig= either a data-type, a tuple of data-types, or a special signature string
 indicating the input and output types of a ufunc.
 This argument allows you to specify a specific signature for a the 1-d
 loop to use in the underlying calculation.
 If the loop specified does not exist for the ufunc, then a TypeError is
 raised.
 Normally a suitable loop is found automatically by comparing the input
 types with what is available and searching for a loop with data-types to
 which all inputs can be cast safely.
 This key-word argument lets you by-pass that search and choose a loop you
 want.
 A list of available signatures is available in the 
\series bold
types
\series default
 attribute of the ufunc object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
extobj= a list of length 1, 2, or 3 specifying the ufunc buffer-size, the
 error mode integer, and the error call-back function.
 Normally, these values are looked-up in a thread-specific dictionary.
 Passing them here bypasses that look-up and uses the low-level specification
 provided for the error-mode.
 This may be useful as an optimization for calculations requiring lots of
 ufuncs on small arrays in a loop.

Casting Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ufunc!casting rules"

\end_inset

At the core of every ufunc is a one-dimensional strided loop that implements
 the actual function for a specific type combination.
 When a ufunc is created, it is given a static list of inner loops and a
 corresponding list of type signatures over which the ufunc operates.
 The ufunc machinery uses this list to determine which inner loop to use
 for a particular case.
 You can inspect the 
\family typewriter
.types
\family default
 attribute for a particular ufunc to see which type combinations have a
 defined inner loop and which output type they produce (the character codes
 are used in that output for brevity).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Casting must be done on one or more of the inputs whenever the ufunc does
 not have a core loop implementation for the input types provided.
 If an implementation for the input types cannot be found, then the algorithm
 searches for an implementation with a type signature to which all of the
 inputs can be cast 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

safely.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The first one it finds in its internal list of loops is selected and performed

 Recall that internal copies during ufuncs (even for casting) are limited
 to the size of an internal buffer which is user settable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note
Universal functions in NumPy are flexible enough to have mixed type signatures.
 Thus, for example, a universal function could be defined that works with
 floating point and integer values.

By the above description, the casting rules are essentially implemented
 by the question of when a data type can be cast

safely
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to another data type.
 The answer to this question can be determined in Python with a function
 call: can_cast (fromtype, totype).

You should note that, while included in the table for completeness, the
 'S', 'U', and 'V' types cannot be operated on by ufuncs.
 Also, note that on a 64-bit system the integer types may have different

Mixed scalar-array operations use a different set of casting rules that
 ensure that a scalar cannot upcast an array unless the scalar is of a fundament
ally different kind of data (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 under a different hierachy in the data type hierarchy) then the array.
 This rule enables you to use scalar constants in your code (which as Python
 types are interpreted accordingly in ufuncs) without worrying about whether
 the precision of the scalar constant will cause upcasting on your large
 (small precision) array.

\begin_layout Section
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ufunc!methods|("

\end_inset

All ufuncs have 4 methods.
 However, these methods only make sense on ufuncs that take two input arguments
 and return one output argument.
 Attempting to call these methods on other ufuncs will cause a 
\family typewriter
ValueError
\family default
.
 The reduce-like methods all take an axis keyword and a dtype keyword, and
 the arrays must all have dimension >= 1.
 The 
\emph on
axis
\emph default
 keyword specifies which axis of the array the reduction will take place
 over and may be negative, but must be an integer.
 The 
\emph on
dtype
\emph default
 keyword allows you to manage a very common problem that arises when naively
 using <op>.reduce.
 Sometimes you may have an array of a certain data type and wish to add
 up all of its elements, but the result does not fit into the data type
 of the array.
 This commonly happens if you have an array of single-byte integers.
 The dtype keyword allows you to alter the data type that the reduction
 takes place over (and therefore the type of the output).
 Thus, you can ensure that the output is a data type with large-enough precision
 to handle your output.
 The responsibility of altering the reduce type is mostly up to you.
 There is one exception: if no dtype is given for a reduction on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

add
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multiply
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operations, then if the input type is an integer (or boolean) data-type
 and smaller than the size of the int_ data type, it will be internally
 upcast to the int_ (or uint) data type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Warning
A reduce-like operation on an array with a data type that has range 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to handle the result will silently wrap.
 You should use dtype to increase the data type over which reduction takes
 place.

\end_inset

For each one-dimensional sequence along the 
\emph on
axis
\emph default
 dimension of the array, return a single number resulting from recursively
 applying the operation to succesive elements along that dimension.
 If the input array has 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 dimensions, then the returned array has 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 dimensions.
 This produces the equivalent of the following Python code :
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>> indx = [index_exp[:]]*array.ndim
\newline
>>> indx[axis] = 0; N=array.shape[axis]

 to do generic indexing in Python using

This method is similar to reduce, except it returns an array of the same

 This method underlies the operations of the cumsum and cumprod methods
 of arrays.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "ufunc!methods!reduceat"

\end_inset

This method is a generalization of both reduce and accumulate.
 It offers the ability to reduce along an axis but only between certain
 indices.
 The indices input must be a one dimensional (index) sequence.
 Then, if 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 element of indices, the reduceat method computes <op>.reduce(array[
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k+1}$
\end_inset

]).
 This formula assumes 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k+1}>I_{k}$
\end_inset

, and also that 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 is the length of the input array when 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the last element.
 There is no requirement that the indices be monotonic.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k+1}\leq I_{k},$
\end_inset

 then reduceat simply returns array[
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}$
\end_inset

] for that particular element of indices.
 In these formulas, we have assumed that array is one dimensional (or axis
 is 0).
 If the array is 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional and axis>0, then the index expression needs axis ':' (full
 slice objects) inserted (i.e.
 array[
\begin_inset Formula $\underbrace{:,\ldots,:}_{\textrm{axis}},I_{k}:I_{k+1}$
\end_inset

]).
 The effect is to slice along the axis dimension.
 Equivalent Python code is

\begin_layout Tip
The optional output arguments can be used to help you save memory for large
 calculations.
 If your arrays are large, complicated expressions can take longer than
 absolutely necessary due to the creation and (later) destruction of temporary
 calculation spaces.
 For example, the expression 'G=a*b+c' is equivalent to t1=A*B; G=T1+C;
 del t1; It will be more quickly executed as G=A*B; add(G,C,G) which is
 the same as G=A*B; G+=C.

\begin_layout Tip
The Python function max() will find the maximum over a one-dimensional array,
 but it will do so using a slower sequence interface.
 The reduce method of the maximum ufunc is much faster.
 Also, the max() method will not give answers you might expect for arrays
 with greater than one dimension.
 The reduce method of minimum also allows you to compute a total minimum
 over an array.

\begin_layout Warning
the behavior of maximum(a,b) is than that of max(a,b).
 As a ufunc, maximum(a,b) performs an element-by-element comparison of a
 and b and chooses each element of the result according to which element
 in the two arrays is larger.
 In contrast, max(a,b) treats the objects a and b as a whole, looks at the
 (total) truth value of a>b and uses it to return either a or b (as a whole).
 A similar difference exists between minimum(a,b) and min(a,b).

Sometimes having the

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 frequencies at the end of the output returned by fft can be a little confusing.
 There are two ways to deal with this confusion.
 In my opinion, the most useful way is to get a collection of DFT sample
 frequencies and use them to keep track of where each frequency is.
 The function 
\family typewriter
fftfreq
\family default
 provides these sample frequencies.
 Making an x-y plot, where the sample frequencies are along the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-axis and the result of the DFT is along the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

y
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-axis provides a useful visualization with the zero-frequency at the center
 of the plot.
 The advantage of this approach is that your data is still in proper order
 for using the 
\family typewriter
ifft
\family default
 function.
 Some people, however, prefer to simply swap one-half of the output with
 the other.
 This is exactly what the function 
\family typewriter
fftshift
\family default
 does.
 Of course, now the data is not in the proper order for the ifft function,
 but to each his own.

The reason that the

 description of the DFT.
 The reason is that the output of the DFT is just one period of a periodic
 function (with period 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The traditional output of the FFT algorithm is to provide the portion of
 the function from from

\end_inset

 and can be realized by repeated application of the 1-d fft (first over
 the axes[0] and then over axes[1]).
 In other-words fft2(x,s,axes) is equivalent to fft(fft(x, s[0], axes[0]),
 s[1], axes[1]).
 The 2-d fft is returned for 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}=0\ldots s[0]-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}=0\ldots s[1]-1.$
\end_inset

 Symmetry (
\begin_inset Formula $X\left[s[0]-k_{0},s[1]-k_{1}\right]=X[-k_{0},-k_{1}]$

\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$

The Discrete Fourier transform returns complex-valued data (even for real-valued
 input).
 If the data was originally real-valued, then much of the output of the
 full DFT is redundant.
 Notice that if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left[m\right]$
\end_inset

 is real, then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
X\left[n-k\right] & = & \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}x[m]\exp\left(-j\frac{2\pi\left(n-k\right)m}{n}\right)\\
 & = & \left[\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}x\left[m\right]\exp\left(-j\frac{2\pi km}{n}\right)\right]^{*}\\
 & = & X^{*}\left[k\right],\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 denotes the complex-conjugate of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 So, the upper half of the fft output (the negative frequencies) is determined
 exactly by the lower half of the output when the input is purely real.
 This kind of symmetry is called Hermitian symmetry.
 The real-valued Fourier transforms described next take advantage of Hermitian
 symmetry to compute only the unique outputs more quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symmetry in higher dimensions is always about the origin.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of dimensions, then: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
X[n_{1}-k_{1},n_{2}-k_{2},\ldots n_{N}-k_{N}]=X^{*}\left[k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{N}\right].\]

\end_inset

Thus, the data-savings remains constant at about 1/2 for higher dimensions
 as well.

The random number capabilities surpass those that were available in Numeric.
 The random number facilities were generously contributed by Robert Kern,
 who has been a dedicated and patient help to many mailing list questioners.
 Robert built the random package using Pyrex to build on top of his own
 code as well as that of randomkit by Jean-Sebastien Roy as well as code
 by Ivan Frohne.
 The fundamental random number generator is the Mersenne Twister based on
 code written by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (and modified for
 Python by Raymond Hettinger).
 Random numbers from discrete and continuous distributions are available,
 as well as some useful random-number-related utilities.
 Many of the random number generators are based on algorithms published

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the discrete and continuous random number generators take a size
 keyword.
 If this is None (default), then the size is determined from the additional
 inputs (using ufunc-like broadcasting).
 If no additional inputs are needed, or if these additional inputs are scalars,
 then a single number is generated from the selected distribution.
 If size is an integer, then a 1-d array of that size is generated filled
 with random numbers from the selected distribution.
 Finally, if size is a tuple, then an array of that shape is returned filled
 with random numbers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many distributions take additional inputs as parameters.
 These additional inputs must be broadcastable to each other (and to the
 size parameter if it is not None).
 The broadcasting behavior of the additional inputs is ufunc-like.

 However, for continuous random number generators, the resulting random

 To obtain the probability that the random number generated by

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain a probability, we have to integrate

 Most continuous distributions are defined by their probability density

 Some have basic origins, a few are derived from other distributions, and
 some are used mainly for modelling unknown distributions.

 These parameters are not shown in the equation for the pdf.
 because they affect the distribution in a known way.
 This is due to the fact that if

 Create a class object that can be used in the argtypes list of a ctypes
 function that will do basic type, number-of-dimensions, shape, and flags
 checking on input array objects.
 Setting an argtypes entry with the result of this function allows passing
 arrays directly to ctypes-wrapped functions.
 The returned class object will contain a from_param method as required
 by ctypes.
 This from_param method takes the array object, does data-type, number-of-dimens
ions, shape, and flags checking on the object and if all tests pass returns
 an object that ctypes can use as the data area of the array.
 Checking is not performed for any entries which are None in this class
 creation function.

\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "distutils"

\end_inset

NumPy provides enhanced distutils functionality to make it easier to build
 and install sub-packages, auto-generate code, and extension modules that
 use Fortran-compiled libraries.
 To use features of numpy distutils use the setup command from numpy.distutils.cor
e.
 A useful Configuration class is also provided in numpy.distutils.misc_util
 that can make it easier to construct keyword arguments to pass to the setup
 function (by passing the dictionary obtained from the todict() method of
 the class).
 More information is available in the NumPy Distutils Users Guide in <site-packa
ges>/numpy/doc/DISTUTILS.txt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "Configuration"

\end_inset

Construct a configuration instance for the given package name.
 If parent_name is not None, then construct the package as a sub-package
 of the parent_name package.
 If top_path and package_path are None then they are assumed equal to the
 path of the file this instance was created in.
 The setup.py files in the numpy distribution are good examples of how to
 use the Configuration instance.
\end_layout

 setup function.
 Thus, this method may be used as setup(**config.todict()).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
self.get_subpackage (subpackage_name, subpackage_path=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Return a Configuration instance for the sub-package given.
 If subpackage_path is None then the path is assumed to be the local path
 plus the subpackage_name.
 If a setup.py file is not found in the subpackage_path, then a default configura
tion is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
self.add_subpackage (subpackage_name, subpackage_path=None)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Add a sub-package to the current Configuration instance.
 This is useful in a setup.py script for adding sub-packages to a package.
 The sub-package is contained in subpackage_path / subpackage_name and this
 directory may contain a setup.py script or else a default setup (suitable
 for Python-code-only subpackages) is assumed.
 If the subpackage_path is None, then it is assumed to be located in the
 local path / subpackage_name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
self.add_data_files (*files)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Add files to the list of data_files to be included with the package.
 The form of each element of the files sequence is very flexible allowing
 many combinations of where to get the files from the package and where
 they should ultimately be installed on the system.
 The most basic usage is for an element of the files argument sequence to
 be a simple filename.
 This will cause that file from the local path to be installed to the installati
on path of the self.name package (package path).
 The file argument can also be a relative path in which case the entire
 relative path will be installed into the package directory.
 Finally, the file can be an absolute path name in which case the file will
 be found at the absolute path name but installed to the package path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 This basic behavior can be augmented by passing a 2-tuple in as the file
 argument.
 The first element of the tuple should specify the relative path (under
 the package install directory) where the remaining sequence of files should
 be installed to (it has nothing to do with the file-names in the source
 distribution).
 The second element of the tuple is the sequence of files that should be
 installed.
 The files in this sequence can be filenames, relative paths, or absolute
 paths.
 For absolute paths the file will be installed in the top-level package
 installation directory (regardless of the first argument).
 Filenames and relative path names will be installed in the package install
 directory under the path name given as the first element of the tuple.
 An example may clarify:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
self.add_data_files('foo.dat',
\newline
('fun', ['gun.dat', 'nun/pun.dat', '/tmp/sun.dat']),

\InsetSpace ~
 An additional feature is that the path to a data-file can actually be a
 function that takes no arguments and returns the actual path(s) to the
 data-files.
 This is useful when the data files are generated while building the package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
self.add_data_dir (data_path)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Recursively add files under data_path to the list of data_files to be installed
 (and distributed).
 The data_path can be either a relative path-name, or an absolute path-name,
 or a 2-tuple where the first argument shows where in the install directory
 the data directory should be installed to.
 For example suppose the source directory contains fun/foo.dat and fun/bar/car.dat
\end_layout

 installation location relative to the <python-include> path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
self.add_extension (name, sources, **kw)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 Create and add an Extension instance to the ext_modules list.
 The first argument defines the name of the extension module that will be
 installed under the self.name package.
 The second argument is a list of sources.
 This method also takes the following optional keyword arguments that are
 passed on to the Extension constructor: include_dirs, define_macros, undef_macr
os, library_dirs, libraries, runtime_library_dirs, extra_objects, swig_opts,
 depends, language, f2py_options, module_dirs, and extra_info.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The self.paths(...) method is applied to all lists that may contain paths.
 The extra_info is a dictionary or a list of dictionaries whose content
 will be appended to the keyword arguments.
 The depends list contains paths to files or directories that the sources
 of the extension module depend on.
 If any path in the depends list is newer than the extension module, then
 the module will be rebuilt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\InsetSpace ~
 The list of sources may contain functions (called source generators) which
 must take an extension instance and a build directory as inputs and return
 a source file or list of source files or None.
 If None is returned then no sources are generated.
 If the Extension instance has no sources after processing all source generators
, then no extension module is built.

name "code generation"

\end_inset

NumPy distutils supports automatic conversion of source files named <somefile>.sr
c.
 This facility can be used to maintain very similar code blocks requiring
 only simple changes between blocks.
 During the build phase of setup, if a template file named <somefile>.src
 is encountered, a new file named <somefile> is constructed from the template
 and placed in the build directory to be used instead.
 Two forms of template conversion are supported.
 The first form occurs for files named named <file>.ext.src where ext is a
 recognized Fortran extension (f, f90, f95, f77, for, ftn, pyf).
 The second form is used for all other cases.

 blocks in the file with names that contain '<...>' according to the rules
 in '<...>'.
 The number of comma-separated words in '<...>' determines the number of times
 the block is repeated.
 What these words are indicates what that repeat rule, '<...>', should be replaced
 with in each block.
 All of the repeat rules in a block must contain the same number of comma-separa
ted words indicating the number of times that block should be repeated.
 If the word in the repeat rule needs a comma, leftarrow, or rightarrow,
 then prepend it with a backslash '
\backslash

 If a word in the repeat rule matches '

<index>' then it will be replaced with the <index>-th word in the same repeat
 specification.
 There are two forms for the repeat rule: named and short.

 On each repeat of the block, the entire expression, '<...>' will be replaced
 first with item1, and then with item2, and so forth until N repeats are
 accomplished.
 Once a named repeat specification has been introduced, the same repeat
 rule may be used 
\series bold
in the current block
\series default
 by referring only to the name (i.e.
 <rule1>.

Short repeat rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A short repeat rule looks like <item1, item2, item3, ..., itemN>.
 The rule specifies that the entire expression, '<...>' should be replaced
 first with item1, and then with item2, and so forth until N repeats are
 accomplished.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pre-defined names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following predefined named repeat rules are available:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
<prefix=s,d,c,z>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
<_c=s,d,c,z>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
<_t=real, double precision, complex, double complex>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
<ftype=real, double precision, complex, double complex>

Other files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-Fortran files use a separate syntax for defining template blocks that
 should be repeated using a variable expansion similar to the named repeat
 rules of the Fortran-specific repeats.
 The template rules for these files are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/**begin repeat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a line by itself marks the beginning of a segment that should be repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Named variable expansions are defined using #name=item1, item2, item3, ...,
 itemN# and placed on successive lines.
 These variables are replaced in each repeat block with corresponding word.
 All named variables in the same repeat block must define the same number
 of words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In specifying the repeat rule for a named variable, item*N is short-hand
 for item, item, ..., item repeated N times.
 In addition, parenthesis in combination with *N can be used for grouping
 several items that should be repeated.
 Thus, #name=(item1, item2)*4# is equivalent to #name=item1, item2, item1,
 item2, item1, item2, item1, item2#
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a line by itself marks the end of the the variable expansion naming.
 The next line is the first line that will be repeated using the named rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Inside the block to be repeated, the variables that should be expanded are
 specified as @name@.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/**end repeat**/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a line by itself marks the previous line as the last line of the block
 to be repeated.
