==================
 NumPy and Cython
==================

This directory contains a small example of how to use NumPy and Cython
together.  While much work is planned for the Summer of 2008 as part of the
Google Summer of Code project to improve integration between the two, even
today Cython can be used effectively to write optimized code that accesses
NumPy arrays.

The example provided is just a stub showing how to build an extension and
access the array objects; improvements to this to show more sophisticated tasks
are welcome.

To run it locally, simply type::

  make help

which shows you the currently available targets (these are just handy
shorthands for common commands).
