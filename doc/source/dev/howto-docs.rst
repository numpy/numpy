How to contribute to the NumPy documentation
############################################

This guide will help you decide what to contribute and how to submit it to the
official NumPy documentation.

******************************************************************************
Documentation team meetings
******************************************************************************

The NumPy community has set a firm goal of improving its documentation. We
hold regular documentation meetings on Zoom (dates are announced on the
`numpy-discussion mailing list
<https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion>`__), and everyone
is welcome. Reach out if you have questions or need
someone to guide you through your first steps -- we're happy to help.
Minutes are taken `on hackmd.io <https://hackmd.io/oB_boakvRqKR-_2jRV-Qjg>`__
and stored in the `NumPy Archive repository
<https://github.com/numpy/archive>`__.

*************************
What's needed
*************************
NumPy docs have the details covered. API reference
documentation is generated directly from
`docstrings <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ in the code
when the documentation is :ref:`built<howto-build-docs>`.

What we lack are docs with broader scope -- tutorials, how-tos, and explanations.
Reporting defects is another way to contribute. We discuss both.

*************************
Contributing fixes
*************************

We're eager to hear about and fix doc defects. But to attack the biggest
problems we end up having to defer or overlook some bug reports. Here are the
best defects to go after.

Top priority goes to **technical inaccuracies** -- a docstring missing a
parameter, a faulty description of a function/parameter/method, and so on.
Other "structural" defects like broken links also get priority. All these fixes
are easy to confirm and put in place. You can submit
a `pull request (PR) <https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#devindex>`__
with the fix, if you know how to do that; otherwise please `open an issue
<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`__.

**Typos and misspellings** fall on a lower rung; we welcome hearing about them but
may not be able to fix them promptly. These too can be handled as pull
requests or issues.

Obvious **wording** mistakes (like leaving out a "not") fall into the typo
category, but other rewordings -- even for grammar -- require a judgment call,
which raises the bar. Test the waters by first presenting the fix as an issue.

Contributing new pages
******************************************************************************

Your frustrations using our documents are our best guide to what needs fixing.

If you write a missing doc you join the front line of open source, but it's
a meaningful contribution just to let us know what's missing. If you want to
compose a doc, run your thoughts by the `mailing list
<https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion>`__ for futher
ideas and feedback. If you want to alert us to a gap,
`open an issue <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`__. See
`this issue <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760>`__ for an example.

If you're looking for subjects, our formal roadmap for documentation is a
*NumPy Enhancement Proposal (NEP)*,
`NEP 44 - Restructuring the NumPy Documentation <https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0044-restructuring-numpy-docs>`__.
It identifies areas where our docs need help and lists several
additions we'd like to see, including Jupyter notebooks.

You can find larger planned and in-progress ideas `at
our GitHub project <https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/2>`__.

Formula writing
==============================================================================
There are formulas for writing useful documents, and four formulas
cover nearly everything. There are four formulas because there are four
categories of document -- ``tutorial``, ``how-to guide``, ``explanation``,
and ``reference``. The insight that docs divide up this way belongs to
Daniele Procida, who goes on
`in this short article <https://documentation.divio.com/>`__ to explain
the differences and reveal the formulas. When you begin a document or
propose one, have in mind which of these types it will be.

More on contributing
==============================================================================

Don't worry if English is not your first language, or if you can only come up
with a rough draft. Open source is a community effort. Do your best -- we'll
help fix issues.

Images and real-life data make text more engaging and powerful, but be sure
what you use is appropriately licensed and available. Here again, even a rough
idea for artwork can be polished by others.

For now, the only data formats accepted by NumPy are those also used by other
Python scientific libraries like pandas, SciPy, or Matplotlib. We're
developing a package to accept more formats; contact us for details.

NumPy documentation is kept in the source code tree. To get your document
into the docbase you must download the tree, :ref:`build it
<howto-build-docs>`, and submit a pull request. If GitHub and pull requests
are new to you, check our :ref:`Contributor Guide <devindex>`.

Our markup language is reStructuredText (rST), which is more elaborate than
Markdown. Sphinx, the tool many Python projects use to build and link project
documentation, converts the rST into HTML and other formats. For more on
rST, see the `Quick reStructuredText Guide
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`__ or the
`reStructuredText Primer
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`__

Contributing indirectly
************************************************************

If you run across outside material that would be a useful addition to the
NumPy docs, let us know by `opening an issue <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`__.

You don't have to contribute here to contribute to NumPy. You've contributed
if you write a tutorial on your blog, create a YouTube video, or answer questions
on Stack Overflow and other sites.
