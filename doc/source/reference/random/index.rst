numpy.random
============

Numpy's random number routines produce pseudo random numbers using
combinations of a `BitGenerator` to create sequences and a `Generator`
to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions:

* SeedSequence: Objects that provide entropy for the initial state of a
  BitGenerator. A good SeedSequence will provide initializations across the
  entire range of possible states for the BitGenerator, otherwise biases may
  creep into the generated bit streams.
* BitGenerators: Objects that generate random numbers. These are typically
  unsigned integer words filled with sequences of either 32 or 64 random bits.
* Generators: Objects that transform sequences of random bits from a
  BitGenerator into sequences of numbers that follow a specific probability
  distribution (such as uniform, Normal or Binomial) within a specified
  interval.

Since Numpy version 1.17.0 the Generator can be initialized with a
number of different BitGenerators. It exposes many different probability
distributions. See `NEP 19 <https://www.numpy.org/neps/
nep-0019-rng-policy.html>`_ for context on the updated random Numpy number
routines. The legacy `RandomState` random number routines are still
available, but limited to a single BitGenerator.

For convenience and backward compatibility, a single `RandomState`
instance's methods are imported into the numpy.random namespace, see
:ref:`legacy` for the complete list.

Quick Start
-----------

By default, `Generator` uses normals provided by `PCG64` which will be
statistically more reliable than the legacy methods in `RandomState`

.. code-block:: python

  # Uses the old numpy.random.RandomState
  from numpy import random
  random.standard_normal()

`Generator` can be used as a direct replacement for `~RandomState`, although
the random values are generated by `~PCG64`. The
`Generator` holds an instance of a BitGenerator. It is accessible as
``gen.bit_generator``.

.. code-block:: python

  # As replacement for RandomState(); default_gen() instantiates Generator with
  # the default PCG64 BitGenerator.
  from numpy.random import default_gen
  rg = default_gen()
  rg.standard_normal()
  rg.bit_generator

Seeds can be passed to any of the BitGenerators. The provided value is mixed
via `~.SeedSequence` to spread a possible sequence of seeds across a wider
range of initialization states for the BitGenerator. Here `~.PCG64` is used and
is wrapped with a `~.Generator`.

.. code-block:: python

  from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64
  rg = Generator(PCG64(12345))
  rg.standard_normal()

Introduction
------------
RandomGen takes a different approach to producing random numbers from the
`RandomState` object.  Random number generation is separated into three
components, a seed sequence, a bit generator and a random generator.

The `BitGenerator` has a limited set of responsibilities. It manages state
and provides functions to produce random doubles and random unsigned 32- and
64-bit values.

The `SeedSequence` takes a seed and provides the initial state for the
`BitGenerator`. Since consecutive seeds can cause bad effects when comparing
`BitGenerator` streams, the `SeedSequence` uses current best-practice methods
to spread the initial state out. However small seeds may still be unable to
reach all possible initialization states, which can cause biases among an
ensemble of small-seed runs. For many cases, that doesn't matter. If you just
want to hold things in place while you debug something, biases aren't a
concern.  For actual simulations whose results you care about, let
``SeedSequence(None)`` do its thing and then log/print the
`SeedSequence.entropy` for repeatable `BitGenerator` streams.

The `random generator <Generator>` takes the
bit generator-provided stream and transforms them into more useful
distributions, e.g., simulated normal random values. This structure allows
alternative bit generators to be used with little code duplication.

The `Generator` is the user-facing object that is nearly identical to
`RandomState`. The canonical method to initialize a generator passes a
`~mt19937.MT19937` bit generator, the underlying bit generator in Python -- as
the sole argument. Note that the BitGenerator must be instantiated.
.. code-block:: python

  from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64
  rg = Generator(PCG64())
  rg.random()

Seed information is directly passed to the bit generator.

.. code-block:: python

  rg = Generator(PCG64(12345))
  rg.random()

What's New or Different
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. warning::

  The Box-Muller method used to produce NumPy's normals is no longer available
  in `Generator`.  It is not possible to reproduce the exact random
  values using Generator for the normal distribution or any other
  distribution that relies on the normal such as the `numpy.random.gamma` or
  `numpy.random.standard_t`. If you require bitwise backward compatible
  streams, use `RandomState`.

* The Generator's normal, exponential and gamma functions use 256-step Ziggurat
  methods which are 2-10 times faster than NumPy's Box-Muller or inverse CDF
  implementations.
* Optional ``dtype`` argument that accepts ``np.float32`` or ``np.float64``
  to produce either single or double prevision uniform random variables for
  select distributions
* Optional ``out`` argument that allows existing arrays to be filled for
  select distributions
* `~entropy.random_entropy` provides access to the system
  source of randomness that is used in cryptographic applications (e.g.,
  ``/dev/urandom`` on Unix).
* All BitGenerators can produce doubles, uint64s and uint32s via CTypes
  (`~PCG64.ctypes`) and CFFI
  (:meth:`~PCG64.cffi`). This allows the bit generators to
  be used in numba.
* The bit generators can be used in downstream projects via
  :ref:`Cython <randomgen_cython>`.
* `~.Generator.integers` is now the canonical way to generate integer
  random numbers from a discrete uniform distribution. The ``rand`` and
  ``randn`` methods are only available through the legacy `~.RandomState`.
  The ``endpoint`` keyword can be used to specify open or closed intervals.
  This replaces both ``randint`` and the deprecated ``random_integers``.
* `~.Generator.random` is now the canonical way to generate floating-point
  random numbers, which replaces `random_sample`, `sample`, and `ranf`. This
  is consistent with Python's `random.random`.

See :ref:`new-or-different` for a complete list of improvements and
differences from the traditional ``Randomstate``.
