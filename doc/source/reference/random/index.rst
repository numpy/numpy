numpy.random
============

Numpy's random number routines produce psuedo random numbers using
combinations of a `BitGenerator` to create sequences and a `Generator`
to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions:

* BitGenerators: Objects that generate random numbers. These are typically
  unsigned integer words filled with sequences of either 32 or 64 random bits.
* Generators: Objects that transform sequences of random bits from a
  BitGenerator into sequences of numbers that follow a specific probability
  distribution (such as uniform, Normal or Binomial) within a specified
  interval.

Since Numpy version 1.17.0 the Generator can be initialized with a
number of different BitGenerators. It exposes many different probability
distributions. See `NEP 19 <https://www.numpy.org/neps/
nep-0019-rng-policy.html>`_ for context on the updated random Numpy number
routines. The legacy `RandomState` random number routines are still
available, but limited to a single BitGenerator.

For convenience and backward compatibility, a single `RandomState`
instance's methods are imported into the numpy.random namespace, see
:ref:`legacy` for the complete list.

Quick Start
-----------

By default, `Generator` uses normals provided by `xoshiro256.Xoshiro256`
which will be faster than the legacy methods in `RandomState`

.. code-block:: python

  # Uses the old numpy.random.RandomState
  from numpy import random
  random.standard_normal()

`Generator` can be used as a direct replacement for `~RandomState`, although
the random values are generated by `~xoshiro256.Xoshiro256`. The
`Generator` holds an instance of a BitGenerator. It is accessable as
``gen.bit_generator``.

.. code-block:: python

  # As replacement for RandomState()
  from numpy.random import Generator
  rg = Generator()
  rg.standard_normal()
  rg.bit_generator


Seeds can be passed to any of the BitGenerators. Here `mt19937.MT19937` is used
and is the wrapped with a `~.Generator`.


.. code-block:: python

  from numpy.random import Generator, MT19937
  rg = Generator(MT19937(12345))
  rg.standard_normal()


Introduction
------------
RandomGen takes a different approach to producing random numbers from the
`RandomState` object.  Random number generation is separated into two
components, a bit generator and a random generator.

The bit generator has a limited set of responsibilities. It manages state
and provides functions to produce random doubles and random unsigned 32- and
64-bit values. The bit generator also handles all seeding which varies with
different bit generators.

The `random generator <Generator>` takes the
bit generator-provided stream and transforms them into more useful
distributions, e.g., simulated normal random values. This structure allows
alternative bit generators to be used with little code duplication.

The `Generator` is the user-facing object that is nearly identical to
`RandomState`. The canonical method to initialize a generator passes a
`~mt19937.MT19937` bit generator, the underlying bit generator in Python -- as
the sole argument. Note that the BitGenerator must be instantiated.
.. code-block:: python

  from numpy.random import Generator, MT19937
  rg = Generator(MT19937())
  rg.random()

Seed information is directly passed to the bit generator.

.. code-block:: python

  rg = Generator(MT19937(12345))
  rg.random()

What's New or Different
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. warning::

  The Box-Muller method used to produce NumPy's normals is no longer available
  in `Generator`.  It is not possible to reproduce the exact random
  values using Generator for the normal distribution or any other
  distribution that relies on the normal such as the `numpy.random.gamma` or
  `numpy.random.standard_t`. If you require bitwise backward compatible
  streams, use `RandomState`.

* The Generator's normal, exponential and gamma functions use 256-step Ziggurat
  methods which are 2-10 times faster than NumPy's Box-Muller or inverse CDF
  implementations.
* Optional ``dtype`` argument that accepts ``np.float32`` or ``np.float64``
  to produce either single or double prevision uniform random variables for
  select distributions
* Optional ``out`` argument that allows existing arrays to be filled for
  select distributions
* `~entropy.random_entropy` provides access to the system
  source of randomness that is used in cryptographic applications (e.g.,
  ``/dev/urandom`` on Unix).
* All BitGenerators can produce doubles, uint64s and uint32s via CTypes
  (`~xoshiro256.Xoshiro256.ctypes`) and CFFI
  (:meth:`~xoshiro256.Xoshiro256.cffi`). This allows the bit generators to
  be used in numba.
* The bit generators can be used in downstream projects via
  :ref:`Cython <randomgen_cython>`.
* `~.Generator.integers` is now the canonical way to generate integer
  random numbers from a discrete uniform distribution. The ``rand`` and
  ``randn`` methods are only availabe through the legacy `~.RandomState`.
  The ``endpoint`` keyword can be used to specify open or closed intervals.
  This replaces both ``randint`` and the deprecated ``random_integers``.
* `~.Generator.random` is now the canonical way to generate floating-point
  random numbers, which replaces `random_sample`, `sample`, and `ranf`. This
  is consistent with Python's `random.random`.

See :ref:`new-or-different` for a complete list of improvements and
differences from the traditional ``Randomstate``.

Parallel Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included generators can be used in parallel, distributed applications in
one of two ways:

* :ref:`independent-streams`
* :ref:`jump-and-advance`

Supported BitGenerators
-----------------------
The included BitGenerators are:

* MT19937 - The standard Python BitGenerator. Produces identical results to
  Python using the same seed/state. Adds a `~mt19937.MT19937.jumped` function
  that returns a new generator with state as-if ``2**128`` draws have been made.
* dSFMT - SSE2 enabled versions of the MT19937 generator.  Theoretically
  the same, but with a different state and so it is not possible to produce a
  sequence identical to MT19937. Supports ``jumped`` and so can
  be used in parallel applications. See the `dSFMT authors' page`_.
* Xorshiro256** and Xorshiro512** - The most recently introduced XOR,
  shift, and rotate generator. Supports ``jumped`` and so can be used in
  parallel applications. See the documentation for
  `~xoshiro256.Xoshirt256.jumped` for details. More information about these bit
  generators is available at the `xorshift, xoroshiro and xoshiro authors'
  page`_.
* ThreeFry and Philox - counter-based generators capable of being advanced an
  arbitrary number of steps or generating independent streams. See the
  `Random123`_ page for more details about this class of bit generators.
