Large parts of this manual originate from Travis E. Oliphant's book
`Guide to NumPy <https://archive.org/details/NumPyBook>`__ (which generously
entered Public Domain in August 2008). The reference documentation for many of
the functions are written by numerous contributors and developers of
NumPy.
