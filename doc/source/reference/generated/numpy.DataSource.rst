.. currentmodule:: numpy

.. autoclass:: DataSource

   

   .. HACK -- the point here is that we don't want this to appear in the output, but the autosummary should still generate the pages.
      .. autosummary::
         :toctree:
      
         DataSource.abspath
         DataSource.exists
         DataSource.open
