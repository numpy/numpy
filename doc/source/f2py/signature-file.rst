==================
 Signature file
==================

The interface definition file (.pyf) is how you can fine-tune the interface
between Python and Fortran. The syntax specification for signature files
(``.pyf`` files) is modeled on the Fortran 90/95 language specification. Almost
all Fortran standard constructs are understood, both in free and fixed
format (recall that Fortran 77 is a subset of Fortran 90/95). F2PY introduces
some extensions to the Fortran 90/95 language specification that help in the
design of the Fortran to Python interface, making it more "Pythonic".

Signature files may contain arbitrary Fortran code so that any Fortran 90/95
codes can be treated as signature files. F2PY silently ignores Fortran
constructs that are irrelevant for creating the interface. However, this also
means that syntax errors are not caught by F2PY and will only be caught when the
library is built.

.. note::

  Currently, F2PY may fail with some valid Fortran constructs. If this happens,
  you can check the `NumPy GitHub issue tracker
  <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`_ for possible workarounds or
  work-in-progress ideas.

In general, the contents of the signature files are case-sensitive. When
scanning Fortran codes to generate a signature file, F2PY lowers all cases
automatically except in multi-line blocks or when the ``--no-lower`` option is
used.

The syntax of signature files is presented below.

Signature files syntax
======================

Python module block
-------------------

A signature file may contain one (recommended) or more ``python
module`` blocks. The ``python module`` block describes the contents of
a Python/C extension module ``<modulename>module.c`` that F2PY
generates.

.. warning::

   Exception: if ``<modulename>`` contains a substring ``__user__``, then the
   corresponding ``python module`` block describes the signatures of call-back
   functions (see :ref:`Call-back arguments`).

A ``python module`` block has the following structure::

  python module <modulename>
    [<usercode statement>]...
    [
    interface
      <usercode statement>
      <Fortran block data signatures>
      <Fortran/C routine signatures>
    end [interface]
    ]...
    [
    interface
      module <F90 modulename>
        [<F90 module data type declarations>]
        [<F90 module routine signatures>]
      end [module [<F90 modulename>]]
    end [interface]
    ]...
  end [python module [<modulename>]]

Here brackets ``[]`` indicate an optional section, dots ``...`` indicate one or
more of a previous section. So, ``[]...`` is to be read as zero or more of a
previous section.


Fortran/C routine signatures
----------------------------

The signature of a Fortran routine has the following structure::

  [<typespec>] function | subroutine <routine name> \
                [ ( [<arguments>] ) ] [ result ( <entityname> ) ]
    [<argument/variable type declarations>]
    [<argument/variable attribute statements>]
    [<use statements>]
    [<common block statements>]
    [<other statements>]
  end [ function | subroutine [<routine name>] ]

From a Fortran routine signature F2PY generates a Python/C extension
function that has the following signature::

  def <routine name>(<required arguments>[,<optional arguments>]):
       ...
       return <return variables>

The signature of a Fortran block data has the following structure::

  block data [ <block data name> ]
    [<variable type declarations>]
    [<variable attribute statements>]
    [<use statements>]
    [<common block statements>]
    [<include statements>]
  end [ block data [<block data name>] ]

.. _type-declarations:

Type declarations
-----------------

The definition of the ``<argument/variable type declaration>`` part
is

::

  <typespec> [ [<attrspec>] :: ] <entitydecl>

where

::

  <typespec> := byte | character [<charselector>]
             | complex [<kindselector>] | real [<kindselector>]
             | double complex | double precision
             | integer [<kindselector>] | logical [<kindselector>]

  <charselector> := * <charlen>
                 | ( [len=] <len> [ , [kind=] <kind>] )
                 | ( kind= <kind> [ , len= <len> ] )
  <kindselector> := * <intlen> | ( [kind=] <kind> )

  <entitydecl> := <name> [ [ * <charlen> ] [ ( <arrayspec> ) ]
                        | [ ( <arrayspec> ) ] * <charlen> ]
                       | [ / <init_expr> / | = <init_expr> ] \
                         [ , <entitydecl> ]

and

* ``<attrspec>`` is a comma separated list of attributes_;

* ``<arrayspec>`` is a comma separated list of dimension bounds;

* ``<init_expr>`` is a :ref:`C expression <c-expressions>`;

* ``<intlen>`` may be negative integer for ``integer`` type
  specifications. In such cases ``integer*<negintlen>`` represents
  unsigned C integers;

If an argument has no ``<argument type declaration>``, its type is
determined by applying ``implicit`` rules to its name.

Statements
----------

Attribute statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``<argument/variable attribute statement>`` is similar to the
``<argument/variable type declaration>``, but without ``<typespec>``.

An attribute statement cannot contain other attributes, and ``<entitydecl>`` can
be only a list of names. See :ref:`f2py-attributes` for more details on the
attributes that can be used by F2PY.

Use statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The definition of the ``<use statement>`` part is

  ::

    use <modulename> [ , <rename_list> | , ONLY : <only_list> ]

  where

  ::

     <rename_list> := <local_name> => <use_name> [ , <rename_list> ]

* Currently F2PY uses ``use`` statements only for linking call-back modules and
  ``external`` arguments (call-back functions). See :ref:`Call-back arguments`.

Common block statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The definition of the ``<common block statement>`` part is

  ::

    common / <common name> / <shortentitydecl>

  where

  ::

    <shortentitydecl> := <name> [ ( <arrayspec> ) ] [ , <shortentitydecl> ]

* If a ``python module`` block contains two or more ``common`` blocks
  with the same name, the variables from the additional declarations
  are appended.  The types of variables in ``<shortentitydecl>`` are
  defined using ``<argument type declarations>``. Note that the
  corresponding ``<argument type declarations>`` may contain array
  specifications; then these need not be specified in ``<shortentitydecl>``.

Other statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``<other statement>`` part refers to any other Fortran language
  constructs that are not described above. F2PY ignores most of them
  except the following:

  + ``call`` statements and function calls of ``external`` arguments
    (see :ref:`more details on external arguments <external>`);

  + ``include`` statements
      ::

        include '<filename>'
        include "<filename>"

      If a file ``<filename>`` does not exist, the ``include``
      statement is ignored. Otherwise, the file ``<filename>`` is
      included to a signature file.  ``include`` statements can be used
      in any part of a signature file, also outside the Fortran/C
      routine signature blocks.

  + ``implicit`` statements
      ::

        implicit none
	implicit <list of implicit maps>

      where

      ::

        <implicit map> := <typespec> ( <list of letters or range of letters> )

      Implicit rules are used to determine the type specification of
      a variable (from the first-letter of its name) if the variable
      is not defined using ``<variable type declaration>``.  Default
      implicit rules are given by:

      ::

        implicit real (a-h,o-z,$_), integer (i-m)

  + ``entry`` statements
      ::

        entry <entry name> [([<arguments>])]

      F2PY generates wrappers for all entry names using the signature
      of the routine block.

      .. note::

        The ``entry`` statement can be used to describe the signature of an
        arbitrary subroutine or function allowing F2PY to generate a number of
        wrappers from only one routine block signature. There are few
        restrictions while doing this: ``fortranname`` cannot be used,
        ``callstatement`` and ``callprotoargument`` can be used only if they are
        valid for all entry routines, etc.

F2PY statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition, F2PY introduces the following statements:

``threadsafe``
  Uses a ``Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS .. Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS`` block
  around the call to Fortran/C function.

``callstatement <C-expr|multi-line block>``
  Replaces the  F2PY generated call statement to Fortran/C function with
  ``<C-expr|multi-line block>``. The wrapped Fortran/C function is available
  as ``(*f2py_func)``.

  To raise an exception, set ``f2py_success = 0`` in ``<C-expr|multi-line
  block>``.

``callprotoargument <C-typespecs>``
  When the ``callstatement`` statement is used, F2PY may not generate proper
  prototypes for Fortran/C functions (because ``<C-expr>`` may contain function
  calls, and F2PY has no way to determine what should be the proper prototype).

  With this statement you can explicitly specify the arguments of the
  corresponding prototype::

    extern <return type> FUNC_F(<routine name>,<ROUTINE NAME>)(<callprotoargument>);

``fortranname [<actual Fortran/C routine name>]``
  F2PY allows for the use of an arbitrary ``<routine name>`` for a given
  Fortran/C function. Then this statement is used for the ``<actual
  Fortran/C routine name>``.

  If ``fortranname`` statement is used without
  ``<actual Fortran/C routine name>`` then a dummy wrapper is
  generated.

``usercode <multi-line block>``
  When this is used inside a ``python module`` block, the given C code will
  be inserted to generated C/API source just before wrapper function
  definitions.

  Here you can define arbitrary C functions to be used for the
  initialization of optional arguments.

  For example, if ``usercode`` is used twice inside ``python module`` block
  then the second multi-line block is inserted after the definition of
  the external routines.

  When used inside ``<routine signature>``, then the given C code will be
  inserted into the corresponding wrapper function just after the
  declaration of  variables but before any C statements. So, the
  ``usercode`` follow-up can contain both declarations and C statements.

  When used inside the first ``interface`` block, then the given C code will
  be inserted at the end of the initialization function of the extension
  module. This is how the extension modules dictionary can be modified and
  has many use-cases; for example, to define additional variables.

``pymethoddef <multiline block>``
  This is a multi-line block which will be inserted into the definition of a
  module methods ``PyMethodDef``-array. It must be a comma-separated list of
  C arrays (see `Extending and Embedding`__ Python documentation for
  details).  ``pymethoddef`` statement can be used only inside ``python
  module`` block.

.. _f2py-attributes:

Attributes
----------

The following attributes can be used by F2PY.

``optional``
  The corresponding argument is moved to the end of ``<optional arguments>``
  list. A default value for an optional argument can be specified via
  ``<init_expr>`` (see the ``entitydecl`` :ref:`definition <type-declarations>`)

  .. note::

   * The default value must be given as a valid C expression.
   * Whenever ``<init_expr>`` is used, the ``optional`` attribute is set
     automatically by F2PY.
   * For an optional array argument, all its dimensions must be bounded.

``required``
  The corresponding argument with this attribute is considered mandatory. This
  is the default. ``required`` should only be specified if there is a need to
  disable the automatic ``optional`` setting when ``<init_expr>`` is used.

  If a Python ``None`` object is used as a required argument, the argument is
  treated as optional. That is, in the case of array arguments, the memory is
  allocated. If ``<init_expr>`` is given, then the corresponding initialization
  is carried out.

``dimension(<arrayspec>)``
  The corresponding variable is considered as an array with dimensions given in
  ``<arrayspec>``.

``intent(<intentspec>)``
  This specifies the "intention" of the corresponding argument. ``<intentspec>``
  is a comma separated list of the following keys:

  * ``in``
      The corresponding argument is considered to be input-only. This means that
      the value of the argument is passed to a Fortran/C function and that the
      function is expected to not change the value of this argument.

  * ``inout``
      The corresponding argument is marked for input/output or as an *in situ*
      output argument. ``intent(inout)`` arguments can be only
      :term:`contiguous` NumPy arrays (in either the Fortran or C sense) with
      proper type and size. The latter coincides with the default contiguous
      concept used in NumPy and is effective only if ``intent(c)`` is used. F2PY
      assumes Fortran contiguous arguments by default.

      .. note::

         Using ``intent(inout)`` is generally not recommended, as it can cause
         unexpected results. For example, scalar arguments using
         ``intent(inout)`` are assumed to be array objects in order to have
         *in situ* changes be effective. Use ``intent(in,out)`` instead.

      See also the ``intent(inplace)`` attribute.

  * ``inplace``
      The corresponding argument is considered to be an input/output or *in situ* output
      argument. ``intent(inplace)`` arguments must be NumPy arrays of a proper
      size. If the type of an array is not "proper" or the array is
      non-contiguous then the routine will be passed a fixed copy of array,
      which has the :c:data:`NPY_ARRAY_WRITEBACKIFCOPY` flag set, so that the
      result will be copied back to the original array on exit.

      .. note::

        ``intent(inplace)`` is recommended over ``inout``, but not over ``in,out``.

  * ``out``
      The corresponding argument is considered to be a return variable. It is appended to the
      ``<returned variables>`` list. Using ``intent(out)`` sets ``intent(hide)``
      automatically, unless  ``intent(in)`` or ``intent(inout)`` are specified
      as well.

      By default, returned multidimensional arrays are Fortran-contiguous. If
      ``intent(c)`` attribute is used, then the returned multidimensional arrays
      are C-contiguous.

  * ``hide``
      The corresponding argument is removed from the list of required or optional
      arguments. Typically ``intent(hide)`` is used with ``intent(out)``
      or when ``<init_expr>`` completely determines the value of the
      argument like in the following example::

        integer intent(hide),depend(a) :: n = len(a)
        real intent(in),dimension(n) :: a

  * ``c``
      The corresponding argument is treated as a C scalar or C array argument. For the case
      of a scalar argument, its value is passed to a C function as a C scalar
      argument (recall that Fortran scalar arguments are actually C pointer
      arguments).  For array arguments, the wrapper function is assumed to treat
      multidimensional arrays as C-contiguous arrays.

      There is no need to use ``intent(c)`` for one-dimensional
      arrays, irrespective of whether the wrapped function is in Fortran or C.
      This is because the concepts of Fortran- and C contiguity overlap in
      one-dimensional cases.

      If ``intent(c)`` is used as a statement but without an entity
      declaration list, then F2PY adds the ``intent(c)`` attribute to all
      arguments.

      Also, when wrapping C functions, one must use ``intent(c)``
      attribute for ``<routine name>`` in order to disable Fortran
      specific ``F_FUNC(..,..)`` macros.

  * ``cache``
      The corresponding argument is treated as junk memory. No Fortran nor C contiguity
      checks are carried out. Using ``intent(cache)`` makes sense only for array
      arguments, also in conjunction with ``intent(hide)`` or ``optional``
      attributes.

  * ``copy``
      Ensures that the original contents of ``intent(in)`` argument is
      preserved. Typically used with the ``intent(in,out)`` attribute. F2PY
      creates an optional argument ``overwrite_<argument name>`` with the
      default value ``0``.

  * ``overwrite``
      This indicates that the original contents of the ``intent(in)`` argument
      may be altered by the Fortran/C function.  F2PY creates an optional
      argument ``overwrite_<argument name>`` with the default value ``1``.

  * ``out=<new name>``
      Replaces the returned name with ``<new name>`` in the ``__doc__`` string
      of the wrapper function.

  * ``callback``
      Constructs an external function suitable for calling Python functions
      from Fortran. ``intent(callback)`` must be specified before the
      corresponding ``external`` statement. If the 'argument' is not in
      the argument list then it will be added to Python wrapper but only
      by initializing an external function.

      .. note::

         Use ``intent(callback)`` in situations where the Fortran/C code assumes
         that the user implemented a function with a given prototype and linked
         it to an executable. Don't use ``intent(callback)`` if the function
         appears in the argument list of a Fortran routine.

      With ``intent(hide)`` or ``optional`` attributes specified and using a
      wrapper function without specifying the callback argument in the argument
      list; then the call-back function is assumed to be found in the  namespace
      of the F2PY generated extension module where it can be set as a module
      attribute by a user.

  * ``aux``
      Defines an auxiliary C variable in the F2PY generated wrapper function.
      Useful to save parameter values so that they can be accessed in
      initialization expressions for other variables.

      .. note::

         ``intent(aux)`` silently implies ``intent(c)``.

  The following rules apply:

  * If none of ``intent(in | inout | out | hide)`` are specified,
    ``intent(in)`` is assumed.

    * ``intent(in,inout)`` is ``intent(in)``;

    * ``intent(in,hide)`` or ``intent(inout,hide)`` is ``intent(hide)``;

    * ``intent(out)`` is ``intent(out,hide)`` unless ``intent(in)`` or
      ``intent(inout)`` is specified.

  * If ``intent(copy)`` or ``intent(overwrite)`` is used, then an additional
    optional argument is introduced with a name ``overwrite_<argument name>``
    and a default value 0 or 1, respectively.

    * ``intent(inout,inplace)`` is ``intent(inplace)``;

    * ``intent(in,inplace)`` is ``intent(inplace)``;

    * ``intent(hide)`` disables ``optional`` and ``required``.

``check([<C-booleanexpr>])``
  Performs a consistency check on the arguments by evaluating
  ``<C-booleanexpr>``; if ``<C-booleanexpr>`` returns 0, an exception is raised.

  .. note::

     If ``check(..)`` is not used then F2PY automatically generates a few
     standard checks (e.g.  in a case of an array argument, it checks for the
     proper shape and size). Use ``check()`` to disable checks
     generated by F2PY.

``depend([<names>])``
  This declares that the corresponding argument depends on the values
  of variables in the ``<names>`` list. For example, ``<init_expr>``
  may use the values of other arguments.  Using information given by
  ``depend(..)`` attributes, F2PY ensures that arguments are
  initialized in a proper order. If the ``depend(..)`` attribute is not
  used then F2PY determines dependence relations automatically. Use
  ``depend()`` to disable the dependence relations generated by F2PY.

  When you edit dependence relations that were initially generated by
  F2PY, be careful not to break the dependence relations of other
  relevant variables. Another thing to watch out for is cyclic
  dependencies. F2PY is able to detect cyclic dependencies
  when constructing wrappers and it complains if any are found.

``allocatable``
  The corresponding variable is a Fortran 90 allocatable array defined as
  Fortran 90 module data.

.. _external:

``external``
  The corresponding argument is a function provided by user. The
  signature of this call-back function can be defined

  - in ``__user__`` module block,
  - or by demonstrative (or real, if the signature file is a real Fortran
    code) call in the ``<other statements>`` block.

  For example, F2PY generates from:

  .. code-block:: fortran

    external cb_sub, cb_fun
    integer n
    real a(n),r
    call cb_sub(a,n)
    r = cb_fun(4)

  the following call-back signatures:

  .. code-block:: fortran

    subroutine cb_sub(a,n)
        real dimension(n) :: a
        integer optional,check(len(a)>=n),depend(a) :: n=len(a)
    end subroutine cb_sub
    function cb_fun(e_4_e) result (r)
        integer :: e_4_e
        real :: r
    end function cb_fun

  The corresponding user-provided Python function are then:

  .. code-block:: python

    def cb_sub(a,[n]):
        ...
        return
    def cb_fun(e_4_e):
        ...
        return r

  See also the ``intent(callback)`` attribute.

``parameter``
  This indicates that the corresponding variable is a parameter and it must have
  a fixed value. F2PY replaces all parameter occurrences by their corresponding
  values.

Extensions
----------

F2PY directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The F2PY directives allow using F2PY signature file constructs in Fortran 77/90
source codes. With this feature one  can (almost) completely skip the
intermediate signature file generation and apply F2PY directly to Fortran source
codes.

F2PY directives have the following form::

  <comment char>f2py ...

where allowed comment characters for fixed and free format Fortran
codes are ``cC*!#`` and ``!``, respectively. Everything that follows
``<comment char>f2py`` is ignored by a compiler but read by F2PY as a
normal non-comment  Fortran line:

.. note::
  When F2PY finds a line with F2PY directive, the directive is first
  replaced by 5 spaces and then the line is reread.

For fixed format Fortran codes, ``<comment char>`` must be at the
first column of a file, of course. For free format Fortran codes,
the F2PY directives can appear anywhere in a file.

.. _c-expressions:

C expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C expressions are used in the following parts of signature files:

* ``<init_expr>`` for variable initialization;
* ``<C-booleanexpr>`` of the ``check`` attribute;
* ``<arrayspec>`` of the ``dimension`` attribute;
* ``callstatement`` statement, here also a C multi-line block can be used.

A C expression may contain:

* standard C constructs;
* functions from ``math.h`` and ``Python.h``;
* variables from the argument list, presumably initialized before
  according to given dependence relations;
* the following CPP macros:

  ``f2py_rank(<name>)``
    Returns the rank of an array ``<name>``.
  ``f2py_shape(<name>, <n>)``
    Returns the ``<n>``-th dimension of an array ``<name>``.
  ``f2py_len(<name>)``
    Returns the length of an array ``<name>``.
  ``f2py_size(<name>)``
    Returns the size of an array ``<name>``.
  ``f2py_itemsize(<name>)``
    Returns the itemsize of an array ``<name>``.
  ``f2py_slen(<name>)``
    Returns the length of a string ``<name>``.


For initializing an array ``<array name>``, F2PY generates a loop over
all indices and dimensions that executes the following
pseudo-statement::

  <array name>(_i[0],_i[1],...) = <init_expr>;

where ``_i[<i>]`` refers to the ``<i>``-th index value and that runs
from ``0`` to ``shape(<array name>,<i>)-1``.

For example, a function ``myrange(n)`` generated from the following
signature

.. code-block::

       subroutine myrange(a,n)
         fortranname        ! myrange is a dummy wrapper
         integer intent(in) :: n
         real*8 intent(c,out),dimension(n),depend(n) :: a = _i[0]
       end subroutine myrange

is equivalent to ``numpy.arange(n,dtype=float)``.

.. warning::

  F2PY may lower cases also in C expressions when scanning Fortran codes
  (see ``--[no]-lower`` option).

Multi-line blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A multi-line block starts with ``'''`` (triple single-quotes) and ends
with ``'''`` in some *strictly* subsequent line.  Multi-line blocks can
be used only within .pyf files. The contents of a multi-line block can
be arbitrary (except that it cannot contain ``'''``) and no
transformations (e.g. lowering cases) are applied to it.

Currently, multi-line blocks can be used in the following constructs:

* as a C expression of the ``callstatement`` statement;

* as a C type specification of the ``callprotoargument`` statement;

* as a C code block of the ``usercode`` statement;

* as a list of C arrays of the ``pymethoddef`` statement;

+ as documentation string.

Extended char-selector
-----------------------

F2PY extends char-selector specification, usable within a signature
file or a F2PY directive, as follows::

  <extended-charselector> := <charselector>
                          | (f2py_len= <len>)

See :ref:`Character Strings` for usage.
