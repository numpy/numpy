NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a
Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived
objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for
fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation,
sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra,
basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

        modules, and objects included in NumPy. The reference describes how the
        methods work and which parameters can be used. It assumes that you have an
        understanding of the key concepts.
