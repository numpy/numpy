   signature is given.  This is done only for functions written is C,

multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, shape])

Draw samples from a multivariate normal distribution.

The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
generalisation of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
dimensions.

Such a distribution is specified by its mean and covariance matrix,
which are analogous to the mean (average or "centre") and variance
(standard deviation squared or "width") of the one-dimensional normal
distribution.

Parameters
----------
mean : (N,) ndarray
    Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
cov : (N,N) ndarray
    Covariance matrix of the distribution.
shape : tuple of ints, optional
    Given a shape of, for example, (m,n,k), m*n*k samples are
    generated, and packed in an m-by-n-by-k arrangement.  Because each
    sample is N-dimensional, the output shape is (m,n,k,N).  If no
    shape is specified, a single sample is returned.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray
    The drawn samples, arranged according to `shape`.  If the
    shape given is (m,n,...), then the shape of `out` is
    (m,n,...,N).

    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
    value drawn from the distribution.

                   function, cumulative density function, etc.

Notes
-----
The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
univariate normal distribution.

Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
element :math:`C_ij` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
The element :math:`C_ii` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
"spread").

Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
approximations include:

  - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
  - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
    the diagonal)

This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
generated data-points:

>>> mean = [0,0]
>>> cov = [[1,0],[0,100]] # diagonal covariance, points lie on x or y-axis
>>> x,y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,5000).T

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> plt.plot(x,y,'x'); plt.axis('equal'); pyplot.show()

Note that the covariance matrix must be non-negative definite.

Examples
--------
>>> mean = (1,2)
>>> cov = [[1,0],[1,0]]
>>> x = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,(3,3))
>>> x.shape
(3, 3, 2)

The following is probably true, given that 0.6 is roughly twice the
standard deviation:

>>> print list( (x[0,0,:] - mean) < 0.6 )
[True, True]
