cdef class LegacyGenerator:
    """
    LegacyGenerator(brng=None)

    Container providing legacy generators.

    ``LegacyGenerator`` exposes a number of methods for generating random
    numbers for a set of distributions where the method used to produce random
    samples has changed. Three core generators have changed: normals, exponentials
    and gammas. These have been replaced by fster Ziggurat-based methds in 
    ``RadnomGenerator``. ``LegacyGenerator`` retains the slower methods
    to produce samples from these distributions as well as from distributions
    that depend on these such as the Chi-square, power or Weibull.
     
    **No Compatibility Guarantee**

    ``LegacyGenerator`` is evolving and so it isn't possible to provide a
    compatibility guarantee like NumPy does. In particular, better algorithms
    have already been added. This will change once ``RandomGenerator``
    stabilizes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    brng : Basic RNG, optional
        Basic RNG to use as the core generator. If none is provided, uses
        Xoroshiro128.


    Examples
    --------
    Exactly reproducing a NumPy stream requires both a ``RandomGenerator``
    and a ``LegacyGenerator``.  These must share a common ``MT19937`` basic 
    RNG. Functions that are available in LegacyGenerator must be called 
    from ``LegacyGenerator``, and other functions must be called from 
    ``RandomGenerator``.

    >>> from randomgen import RandomGenerator, MT19937
    >>> from randomgen.legacy import LegacyGenerator
    >>> mt = MT19937(12345)
    >>> lg = LegacyGenerator(mt)
    >>> rg = RandomGenerator(mt)
    >>> x = lg.standard_normal(10)
    >>> rg.shuffle(x)
    >>> x[0]
    0.09290787674371767
    >>> lg.standard_exponential()
    1.6465621229906502
    
    The equivalent commands from NumPy produce identical output.

        standard_t(df, size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Student's t distribution with `df` degrees
        of freedom.

        A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.  As `df` gets
        large, the result resembles that of the standard normal
        distribution (`standard_normal`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        df : int or array_like of ints
            Degrees of freedom, should be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized standard Student's t distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the t distribution is

        .. math:: P(x, df) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{df+1}{2})}{\\sqrt{\\pi df}
                  \\Gamma(\\frac{df}{2})}\\Bigl( 1+\\frac{x^2}{df} \\Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}

        The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
        Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
        the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
        a good estimate of the true mean.

        The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
        1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
        in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
        a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

        Examples
        --------
        From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
        women in Kj is:

        >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \\
        ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])

        Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
        value of 7725 kJ?

        We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
        recommended value?

        >>> s = randomgen.standard_t(10, size=100000)
        >>> np.mean(intake)
        6753.636363636364
        >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
        1142.1232221373727

        Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
        value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
        freedom, N-1.

        >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, normed=True)

        For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
        statistic appear?

        >>> np.sum(s<t) / float(len(s))
        0.0090699999999999999  #random

        So the p-value is about 0.009, which says the null hypothesis has a
        probability of about 99% of being true.

        Notes
        -----
        A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
        distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
        distribution is:

        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma x \\sqrt{2\\pi}}
                         e^{(-\\frac{(ln(x)-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2})}

        where :math:`\\mu` is the mean and :math:`\\sigma` is the standard
        deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
        A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
        of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
        the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
        *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
        variables.

        wald(mean, scale, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.

        As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
        Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.

        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : float or array_like of floats
            Distribution mean, should be > 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats
            Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is

        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \\sqrt{\\frac{scale}{2\\pi x^3}}e^
                                    \\frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\\cdotp mean^2x}

        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

        pareto(a, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
        specified shape.

        The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
        distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
        to one and the location set to zero.

        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
        unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
        remaining 80 percent of the range.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Shape of the distribution. Should be greater than zero.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Pareto distribution.

        Notes

        The probability density for the Pareto distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}

        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.

        The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
        Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
        useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
        and many other problems, including the download frequency for
        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
        "fat-tailed" distributions.

        Notes
        -----
        The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution
        for smallest values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler
        distribution) is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value
        (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
        This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.

        The probability density for the Weibull distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{a}
                         {\\lambda}(\\frac{x}{\\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\\lambda)^a},

        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\\lambda` the scale.

        The function has its peak (the mode) at
        :math:`\\lambda(\\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.

        When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
        distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
        rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
        non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
        true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
        hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

        Notes

        The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is

                  (\\frac{x-x_0}{\\gamma})^2 \\bigr] }

        and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
        :math:`\\gamma=1`

        The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
        oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
        also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
        a random angle will cut the x axis.

        When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
        tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
        their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
        very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

        Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
        shape (sometimes designated "k") and scale=1.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter, should be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``shape`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(shape).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized standard gamma distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.gamma : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\\frac{e^{-x/\\theta}}{\\theta^k\\Gamma(k)},

        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\\Gamma` is the Gamma function.

        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

        The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,

        f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)

        Draw samples from an F distribution.

        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
        freedom in denominator), where both parameters should be greater than
        zero.

        The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
        Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
        that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
        variates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : int or array_like of ints
            Degrees of freedom in numerator. Should be greater than zero.
        dfden : int or array_like of ints
            Degrees of freedom in denominator. Should be greater than zero.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``dfnum`` and ``dfden`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Fisher distribution.

            cumulative density function, etc.

        Notes
        -----
        The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
        variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
        so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
        problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
        between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
        degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
        minus the number of groups.

        Examples
        --------
        An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:

        Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
        without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
        case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
        82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
        data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
        status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
        Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.

        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
        >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
        >>> s = randomgen.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)

        The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :

        >>> sort(s)[-10]
        7.61988120985

        So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
        the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
        level.

    def normal(self, loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None):
        """
        normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

        The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
        derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
        independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
        its characteristic shape (see the example below).

        The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
        describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
        by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
        unique distribution [2]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float or array_like of floats
            Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
        scale : float or array_like of floats
            Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

            cumulative density function, etc.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ 2 \\pi \\sigma^2 }}
                         e^{ - \\frac{ (x - \\mu)^2 } {2 \\sigma^2} },

        where :math:`\\mu` is the mean and :math:`\\sigma` the standard
        deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\\sigma^2`,
        is called the variance.

        The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
        :math:`x + \\sigma` and :math:`x - \\sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
        `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to
        the mean, rather than those far away.

        Parameters
        ----------

        p : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),

        Returns

        Notes

        where :math:`n-1` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
        probability of success, and :math:`N+n-1` is the number of trials.
        The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of n-1
        successes and N failures in N+n-1 trials, and success on the (N+n)th
        trial.

        If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
        then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
        appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

        dirichlet(alpha, size=None)

        Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.

        Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
        Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
        generalization of a Beta distribution. Dirichlet pdf is the conjugate
        prior of a multinomial in Bayesian inference.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : array
            Parameter of the distribution (k dimension for sample of
            dimension k).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray,
            The drawn samples, of shape (size, alpha.ndim).

        Notes
        -----
        .. math:: X \\approx \\prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\\alpha_i-1}_i}

        Uses the following property for computation: for each dimension,
        draw a random sample y_i from a standard gamma generator of shape
        `alpha_i`, then
        :math:`X = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^k{y_i}} (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)` is
        Dirichlet distributed.

        """
        multivariate_normal(self, mean, cov, size=None, check_valid='warn', tol=1e-8)

        Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.

        The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
        generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
        dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
        covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
        (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
        squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
            Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
        cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
            Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
            positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
            generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
            each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
            If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
        check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
            Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
        tol : float, optional
            Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.

            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
        location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
        analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
        univariate normal distribution.

        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
        From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
        samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
        element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
        The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
        "spread").

        Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
        approximations include:

          - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
          - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
            the diagonal)

        This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
        generated data-points:

        >>> mean = [0, 0]
        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance

        Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> x, y = randomgen.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
        >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
        >>> plt.axis('equal')
        >>> plt.show()

        Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
        nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
        undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
