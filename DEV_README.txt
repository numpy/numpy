Thank you for your willingness to help make NumPy the best array system
available.

We have a few simple rules:

   * try hard to keep the Git repository in a buildable state and to not
     indiscriminately muck with what others have contributed.

   * Simple changes (including bug fixes) and obvious improvements are
     always welcome.  Changes that fundamentally change behavior need
     discussion on numpy-discussions@scipy.org before anything is
     done.

   * Please add meaningful comments when you check changes in.  These
     comments form the basis of the change-log.

   * Add unit tests to exercise new code, and regression tests
     whenever you fix a bug.
